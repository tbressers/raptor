Statement of Worth. We are not addressing the worth of one’s physical possessions
and monetary values, but that worth of an effective and efficiently run IT Asset
Management Program. What is an effective program worth to your organization? The
answer may very well rest in the aftermath of a compliance audit, or a disaster that has
destroyed your physical assets, records and the total being of your organization’s
existence. The mere fact that without some form of focused Program Management
System in place, a vast sum of money and resources will needlessly be lost, and will
greatly reduce the VALUE of your organization in every respect. All of these
possibilities should invoke strong interest in the planning, implementation and execution
of a complete IT Asset Management Program orchestrated to meet the specific needs of
your organization.
Traditionally, organizations have only been told what to do with little or no guidance.
Their needs were not being met by following frameworks and standards that only
described what they should be doing, leaving them stranded to “reinvent the wheel”.
IAITAM Members spoke and IAITAM listened. Our members want a profession that has
standardized, organized and understandable processes. The time has arrived for ITAM
professionals around the world to find the ANSWERS to their questions and the
SOLUTIONS to their ITAM problems.
The IAITAM Best Practice Library™ (IBPL) was written for the advancement of the
ITAM Profession. Our members spoke regarding their disappointment in other
frameworks and matrices currently available, as each of those provided a guide to what
they needed, yet left many members unaware of the steps necessary to obtain the goals
of those frameworks. Other members found it difficult to understand how the
frameworks fit properly into IT Asset Management. It became abundantly clear that a
new form of guidance documentation was necessary.
The IBPL is a series of volumes that drills down into each of the Key Process Areas as
defined by IAITAM, providing the “how to” that is often left out of other frameworks.
This IBPL is THE practitioner’s guide to IT Asset Management. IAITAM painstakingly
developed the IBPL to show IT Asset Managers how to implement, why they need to
implement and most importantly, the VALUE that effective IT Asset Management can
bring to the organization.
IAITAM is very proud to present to you the IBPL; Statement of worth defined.
About The IAITAM Best Practice Library
Throughout the 12 volumes of information created as a “how to” guideline for building
an efficient and effective ITAM program, you will find that certain information seems to
have been duplicated. This is not an oversight, but is an enhancement to the overall
value of information presented to you.
The “duplicate” information is actually part of the Workflows, Templates and
Whitepapers that are provided on the CD included with your purchase. All of the
information on the CD is formatted to allow you to input data specific to your
organizational environment to create an optimal ITAM program.
You will also find that some of the Workflows, Templates and Whitepapers are very
small in printed form to fit the page, yet can be easily altered in size and legibility using
the provided CD.
Every volume of information was expertly created to be the definitive information
source for your asset management needs. Years of experience and thousands of manhours were utilized to create the IBPL in order to fortify the industry and create a
stronger continuity throughout the IT Asset Management community.
When the IBPL is purchased as a full set, one cd is provided with all Workflows,
Templates and Whitepapers and is located in the Program Management Volume. When
the IBPL is purchased in a la carté fashion, a cd is provided with each volume (with the
exception of Volumes 1 and 2; Volume 2 cannot be purchased separately).

Program Management Process
1
INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
The purpose of defining an ITAM Program is to encapsulate and define the overall
strategy, mission, objectives, measurements and prioritization of IT Asset Management
efforts within an organization.
The Program Management process area encompasses providing centralized procedures,
cost saving strategies, accountability for compliance, tools and tracking for all ITAM
related efforts. This also includes the complete lifecycle of assets which follows a “birthto-death” analogy of lifecycle management. Installs, Moves, Adds, Changes (IMAC) is
also part of the process, and represents the underpinnings of a successful software
compliance program, leasing program, and the capability of strategic business planning
that is supported by an accurate inventory.
The function of the program manager is to ensure that all efforts necessary to
accomplish the mission are subdivided into specific initiatives, or projects, and that these
are monitored and controlled through the Key Process Areas. Further, the Program
Manager works to ensure that appropriate resources and commitments are gained from
various organizations across the enterprise, to ensure that teamwork is developed.
Typically the IT Asset Management program will require participation from the following
organizations: Corporate Communications, Facilities, Human Resources, Information
Technology, Legal, Procurement and Executive Management as appropriate.
The Program Management process defines:
➢ Staffing and support roles
➢ Relationships and teamwork necessary to ensure that ITAM functions are
coordinated with a devoted team effort
➢ Tracking of costs to a cost center and better budgeting and chargeback
Chapter 1
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT PROCESS

➢ Better understanding of the service utilized and the resultant costs
➢ Evaluation data for maintenance agreements, types of equipment, etc.
➢ Increased accuracy on all asset statistics, resulting in increased compliance
➢ The support of IT business initiatives such as refresh and upgrade planning,
redeployment, standardization, automated software distribution, and usage
monitoring
➢ Ability to measure service levels for IMAC performance
 Critical Success Factors for the Program include:
➢ Planning
➢ Organization
➢ Budget
➢ Leadership
➢ Coordination and Communication
➢ Control
➢ Status monitoring
➢ Prioritization
➢ Resource management
➢ Support, control and evaluation of projects
DEFINING TOTAL PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
The process of managing multiple ongoing inter-dependant projects. Program
Management places emphasis on coordinating and prioritizing resources across projects,
departments and entities to ensure resources are utilized organization-wide. Program
Management is all encompassing of Project Management, overseeing projects, yet leaving
Project Management to the respective Project Managers.
Program Management Process
3
An IT initiative can involve many functional groups within the organization and, for the
sake of managing a complex project, must be broken down into multiple projects,
perhaps several, sometimes dozens. The collection of all of these projects is a program.
There can be multiple programs active at any one time.
WHY THIS AREA RELATES TO IT ASSET MANAGEMENT
These programs introduce change into the IT infrastructure such as new assets,
redeployment of assets, upgrades and modifications to existing assets and the
destruction of assets. A program invokes the other processes defined in the best
practices, which must include complete Lifecycle Management. This process area entails
the management of a technology from cradle to grave. A simple example is the
automobile, which has its own lifecycle from the time it rolls off the assembly line until
the time it is delivered to the junk yard where its components may be disassembled and
sold off separately. During the life of this vehicle, its usability changes and maintenance
requirements evolve as the vehicle ages. Very much the same concept applies to IT
assets, with the exception of different governmental rules, regulations, restrictions and
organizational guidelines.
Like any other technology, an IT asset has a life where its value to the organization
changes over time and the costs to maintain the asset change as well. Sooner or later
the asset must be replaced, refurbished or redeployed and these actions are all driven
by the lifecycle of the asset. Replacing, refurbishing or redeploying an asset affects
several process areas as defined in ITAM Best Practices, requiring updates to the asset’s
status tracked by the IT group.
Program Management provides a high-level view of all IT projects mapped to the
business objectives that the projects are meant to fulfill. The collection of key process
areas provides a window into the costs and resources required to meet the objectives.
Program Management provides a method for managing large and numerous projects for
the purpose of communicating status and monitoring the health of all projects, as well as
maximizing the use of assets by utilizing the assets to their fullest and upgrading the
asset, when possible, to capitalize on the initial investment.

IMPLEMENTATION GOALS FOR TOTAL PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
IAITAM has defined six core goals as part of the best practice for Program Management:
➢ IT Asset Management activities are identified, planned and executed as a
program consisting of prioritized, managed initiatives
➢ Business cases are developed as part of the IT Asset Management decision
making and prioritization process
➢ Standards for hardware and software are defined and maintained
➢ IT Assets are received, installed, and maintained
➢ Transitions during use (the MAC processes of IMAC) are conducted
➢ Mass change/refresh events are coordinated
GOAL 1: IT ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE IDENTIFIED PLANNED AND EXECUTED
AS A PROGRAM CONSISTING OF PRIORITIZED MANAGED INITIATIVES
Like a well oiled machine, a well planned program runs smoothly because of the time
and consideration devoted to it. When planning a program ensure that:
➢ The program structure is aligned with and supports the overall business
objectives of the organization
➢ The organization monitors and reports on its progress, savings and
achievements
In addition to the attributes listed above, a program plan is written so that:
➢ Initiatives are organized, coordinated and prioritized
➢ Risk of project failure is reduced
Program Management Process

GOAL 2: BUSINESS CASES ARE DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE IT ASSET MANAGEMENT
DECISION MAKING AND PRIORITIZATION PROCESS
A business case identifies specific goals and measures as well as documenting expected
costs, benefits and risks. With this information available, IT Asset Management decision
makers will be able to see that the business case:
➢ Supports the program process
➢ Identifies the key value components that impact return on investment
➢ Addresses all organizational benefits and costs
Further benefits of a well written business case will better allow:
➢ The organization to make investments on an objective and informed basis
➢ The organization to prioritize its efforts based upon achieving the most
significant values up front
➢ The organization to track investments as a part of the program follow-through
to ensure each initiative delivers the value that was projected
GOAL 3: STANDARDS FOR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ARE DEFINED AND MAINTAINED
ITAM Program Management maintains balance between program goals and the overall
business needs. Part of those needs are answered by maintaining the lifecycle of assets
in all respects. From the approval to acceptance, throughout the normal Installs, Moves,
Adds, Changes (IMAC) process and into the redeployment or destruction phase, the IT
Asset Manager must ensure that standards for hardware and software are defined and
maintained in a way that:
➢ Incorporates the current needs of the organization
➢ Reflects the IT strategic plan for the environment
➢ Reflects industry and technical recommendations
➢ Is supported by policy, including expense, exception, and desktop usage topics
BP2
6
➢ Incorporates the appropriate departmental leadership so that standards are
practical and enforceable
➢ Meets the needs of end users
➢ Exceptions are unusual, but have a clear process for approval
➢ Coordinates with the Acquisition selection process
➢ Links hardware with software needs in the same standard
➢ They are reviewed frequently
➢ Standards are published and explained
When the hardware and software standards have been met:
➢ Compliance with standards maintains a high satisfaction rate for users and
budget managers
➢ Security efforts are enhanced through homogeneity in the environment
➢ Technical testing of the standards ( software with other software and software
on hardware) is manageable and timely
➢ Standards reflect upcoming synergistic changes, such as the impact of a new
operating system on hardware
➢ Cost and complexity of support is reduced
➢ Other ITAM strategies such as volume purchasing, and vendor consolidation are
enabled
➢ Quality of service is improved
➢ A catalog of acceptable software and hardware is available for review by
managers, end users, procurement and other interested parties
➢ There is predictability to improve software and hardware budgeting

GOAL 4: IT ASSETS ARE RECEIVED AND INSTALLED
In a small office, the receipt and installation of an asset is a very easy process with few
people involved. This is not the case for a Program Manager in a larger organization,
where there are countless variables involved which include policies, regulations and
many people involved in the process of receiving, identifying, tagging and installing assets.
IAITAM Best Practice recommends a receipt and installation process that:
➢ Is recorded in the help desk system to initiate, record, close and measure the
service
➢ Handles all entry points for reception and installation in the organization in the
same manner, collecting the same data into a centralized system
➢ Supports SLA goals for delivery
➢ Provides a holistic view of the assets that become an individual’s work
environment
➢ Includes the technical steps necessary to deliver the correct configuration
➢ Documentation management processes are followed for the media, manuals and
other license proof materials
➢ Provides an RMA process path so that a replacement is received without
double-billing
➢ Processes for tagging and long term tracking of the asset are accurately applied
or initiated
➢ The new asset is approved by technical testing in the environment
➢ Customization of the asset for the end user is handled in a way that accurately
delivers the expected end product (imaging the right software, special keyboard,
etc.)
➢ Only applies software that is appropriate to the standard and for which there is
record of a license, or follows the proper compliance process
By following the processes, procedures and standards noted above, further benefit is
derived in ways such as:
BP2
8
➢ The tracking of an individual asset is specific to that instance (serial numbers,
specific model, specific user)
➢ The redeployment of warehoused assets follows the same planned path, each
and every time
➢ Providing updates to the financial system for payment of invoice, tax payments
including property tax, chargeback processing, updates to fixed assets as
appropriate and to IT Asset Management repository
➢ Reducing the risk of loss from theft
➢ Providing a process for proof of licensing compliance is facilitated
➢ Preventing theft such as the copying of software assets without proper licensing
➢ The measurement of total cost of ownership including the installation and
instances of service
GOAL 5: TRANSITIONS DURING USE (THE MAC PROCESSES OF IMAC) ARE CONDUCTED
Moves, Adds and Changes are the transition of an asset from its current location to
another, or changes in hardware and/or software, or all of the above. Most times when
movement of an asset is necessary, software and possibly hardware changes are
incurred to facilitate an effective move of the asset, and all moves must include the
changes necessary to facilitate the new work station. A properly managed move will
ensure that:
➢ IMAC service levels are defined and managed with minimal impact to the
business with consideration to warranty and maintenance available on that
particular asset and within scope of the legal agreement
➢ Changes that impact conformity to standards are appropriately approved
➢ Software removal is performed in a clean manner, leaving no code behind
➢ Changes outside of acceptable limits are routed for special handling, including
approvals and/or testing
➢ IMAC activities are coordinated with request management, release management
and change management activities
Program Management Process
9
➢ Request and workflow is automated and tracked as part of the IT service
management capability
By observing and following specified guidelines during moves, the organization will
derive benefits such as:
➢ Work disruption, user frustration and resulting costs are minimized
➢ Standardization is preserved when possible to build pools for redeployment and
to ease lease return
➢ A professional level of quality is perceived by all end-users
➢ Planned moves can be separately reported from unauthorized moves or missing
assets
➢ Customer satisfaction levels with the asset are assessed and reported to the IT
Acquisition team
GOAL 6: MASS CHANGE / REFRESH EVENTS ARE COORDINATED
An important part of asset management is to be prepared for mass change events and
refresh cycles. Knowing the asset life expectancy is a good start in the planning phase,
and when paired with set standards, policies and procedures, helps in preparing the
cycle execution in ways that:
➢ Include planning for technical, licensing, delivery, storage and distribution issues
➢ Builds and maintains individual asset record updates the same as any other MAC
➢ Works with the property or facilities management team when a location move
is involved
➢ Works with the IT strategic direction and provides feedback on technical and
logistic implications
➢ New software and release changes are supported by proper licensing
➢ Documentation to prove ownership is controlled and properly stored according
to documentation management processes
➢ Older releases are removed cleanly, and double checked via a discovery run
BP2
10
➢ MAC activities are coordinated with request management, release management
and change management activities
➢ Request and workflow is automated and tracked as part of the IT service
management capability
When properly executed, mass change and refresh events will provide benefits in ways
that:
➢ Work disruption, user frustration and resulting costs are minimized
➢ Licensing compliance is maintained through only applying licenses appropriately
or harvesting licenses for redistribution
➢ Exceptions to mass change are clearly documented and preserved
➢ A professional level of quality is perceived by all end-users
CORE PROCESSES FOR EFFECTIVE PROGRAM AND LIFE-CYCLE
MANAGEMENT
IT Asset Management activities are identified planned and executed as a
program consisting of prioritized managed initiatives
The ongoing management of the IT assets may be independent of the programs created
by the organization’s business objectives but necessary nonetheless. These projects
must roll up into one or more programs. However, most of the IT projects are driven
by business objectives and therefore inherit the priorities assigned to the business
objectives.
Business cases are developed as part of the IT Asset Management decision
making and prioritization process
The services and products provided by an organization are driven by the organization’s
operations. These operations are automated by IT and of course, the assets. It then
follows that the organization’s business objectives drive IT’s programs. Each year an
organization has multiple business objectives prioritized by the executive team. These
priorities in turn drive IT’s priorities. For example, the organization shall relocate and
combine two separate offices. This priority is driven by a business case, a date has been
set, and IT has little control over it, but, must always be ready to support the decision. 
Program Management Process
11
Standards Development
Defining standards for the assets the organization acquires involves researching the
available configuration, market dynamics and trends and cost / performance. Standards
ensure the asset is usable today and has a life span that justifies the return on
investments (ROI). Standards within an IT Asset Program can range from hardware to
software, services to vendors.
Receiving and installation
This core process starts with the asset being received and tagged upon entry into the
facility, and then the asset is properly deployed according to the vendor’s specification.
This will result in a predictable start to a hopefully long asset life span. The process
describes the steps taken to check the asset in to the asset management system
including proper logging of the asset. The installation is performed by a professionally
trained IT associate putting the asset into a well-defined state ready for use.
Transitions during use (moves, adds, changes)
This process defines the process for the transitioning of an asset. The process identifies
the steps needed for the transition including any updates to the asset management
library. For example, if the asset is moved, then the asset identification process is
invoked.
Mass Change / Refresh Process
The process for performing mass changes to IT assets can be challenging especially when
there is a risk of interrupting the productivity of the users. In this process we
recommend a phased roll out approach where the first phase is applied to a small subset
of the entire population. Upon successful completion of this first phase, a mass change
or refresh can take place. An example of this is the upgrading of an operating system’s
version.
Commitments
➢ Standards for software and hardware are developed by IT working in
conjunction with end user management and the IT program team. Ongoing
support of standards is required and standards should be considered living
standards. Standards must include minimal acceptability for use and the level
expected for disposal
BP2
12
➢ The organization supports and funds the pre-deployment configuration and
testing in support of change and release management including testing facilities,
tools and personnel
➢ Coordination with technical teams managing patch management, the network
monitors, usage monitoring or metering, automated software packaging and
distribution is a necessary commitment
➢ The organization is committed to achieving the business outcomes and goals
identified as part of the IT Asset Management program charter
➢ The commitment is supported through demonstrated executive buy-in and
contribution of effort from the essential resources within each organization
Key roles are formally defined to support the IT Asset Management efforts and are
recognized by the organization. These roles include but are not limited to the following:
➢ Program Manager
➢ IT Asset Manager, IT Asset Management
Capabilities
➢ IMAC activities are coordinated through the incident or request management
system
➢ Software and hardware migration is performed while retaining user required
software, settings, configuration and data
SELF-ASSESSMENT AND ACTION PLANNING
IAITAM has assembled the following program management assessment questions and
action statements to help you establish strengths and weaknesses in your organization.
The program process involves all functional areas of the organization and therefore
requires mediation between these areas. This activity may require a phased
implementation approach based on the maturity of the program process within the
organization. While this approach may seem daunting, people usually respond positively
when asked to help ensure the success of a program that directly affects them.

PROGRAM MANAGEMENT SUB-PROCESSES
Program Management is a multi-faceted process usually consisting of a group of related
projects. The projects may have mutual dependencies that could be quite complex. The 
BP2
18
key to successful Program Management is that the projects need to be managed in a
coordinated manner.
In the overall, a program needs to be laid out into sub-processes for effective
management. Listed below are 6 basic program sub-processes that will facilitate the
steps to a well planned and executed program.

PROGRAM MANAGEMENT - DEVELOPING LIFECYCLE PROCESSES
AND PROCEDURES
Part of any ITAM program is the complete scope and management of asset life-cycle
maintenance. Once an asset has been delivered to the loading dock and officially
received, the actual usage life of the asset begins. Since IT assets are generally kept for
multiple years, the Program Manager has the challenging job of keeping track of these
assets throughout the period of use. With the constant state of change in businesses
today, assets can be quite mobile within the organization, or between organizations with
acquisitions and mergers. Adding to the movement are the changes people make such
as accepting promotions, transferring to another department, or leaving the company.
With all of these factors, the IT assets can move many times during their period of use.
Since the movement is for the most part events that cannot be predicted or managed,
the solution is to build processes for the lifecycle events so that the movement of the
assets can be recorded in a predictable way.
The processes for the movement of assets are generally referred to as “IMAC”, an
acronym for “Install, Move, Add and Change”. Complexity in tracking comes from the
many ways that these basic processes may be occurring in the organization, with the
process potentially unique by asset type, location, ownership and department, just to 
BP2
22
name a few of the variables. Adding to the difficulties, responsibility for IMAC typically
crosses many department lines, often with independent systems that are not integrated.
When the Program Manager begins talking about mapping out the process and perhaps
re-engineering the process to gather data on assets in an automated manner, the
differing agendas of these departments can be a significant roadblock. Obviously, there
is no one right way to perform IMAC for all, but there are very real benefits to be
derived from mapping out these processes and coordinating them through a system or a
series of integrated systems. Those benefits include:
➢ Documenting IMAC activities allows the tracking of assets to a particular cost
center and supports more accurate budgeting
➢ Supports chargeback is a powerful way to distribute the costs to the actual
departments that are using the assets or services associated with those assets
➢ From the point of view of the end user department, tracking of IMAC allows
them to understand the service that they actually receive and the level required,
which is the basis for service level agreements
➢ Allows other money saving activities such as redeployment or the return of
leased equipment on time
➢ A working set of IMAC processes are the basis for planning a refresh and can be
the difference between successful and timely execution, or facing a dismal failure
➢ Through IMAC processes, the data needed for evaluating equipment, service
agreements and maintenance agreements is collected, potentially saving the
corporation from expenditures on unnecessary maintenance
➢ With the advent of Sarbanes Oxley, corporations are developing new
accountability procedures, including increased accuracy on asset statistics.
Lifecycle tracking, including IMAC are key to that accuracy.
Since most IMAC activities are performed by the Help desk or Service desk, the
dilemma is that help desk tools focus on the functionality required to successfully
manage a help desk and not on the tangential values listed above. Asset management
needs to have data kept asset by asset. Help desk data is often kept in an incident by
incident basis. Asset information may be difficult to extract from a series of incidents
and may even be buried in text fields. 
Program Management Process
23
In this next section, common issues with documenting the IMAC lifecycle steps for asset
management purposes will be discussed. The term “Help Desk” is used to describe the
group of people responsible for IMAC and is not meant to imply that this is the only
department, or even the name of the department that may have this role within the
corporation. As an example, Desktop Services is another common name for help desk.
It is not uncommon for this function to be outsourced to a service provider, but that
does not change the information needs and opportunities.
INSTALLS
The acknowledgement of receipt during the Receiving Process should generally have
started a series of events that culminate in payment of the invoice, whether the
information is put into the ERPs, or entered into the financial system through a web
interface or through some other action. Since equipment is ordered in groups on a
single PO, the association of a specific serial numbered asset to a requestor must be
made, but is probably unnecessary detail for the invoice payment process. Fixed asset
systems generally look at assets on the PO level as well, leaving a mismatch to the level
of detail needed for IT asset management.
Long before the installation process is to occur, information about the equipment, the
PO and the ultimate end user (not the ordering person, not even the ship to person)
must be linked together. In a mature IT Asset Management Program, the details of the
request are sent to an asset repository where redeployment can be considered and
then a record created with a status of “on order” when the need for a new purchase is
confirmed. The link to the ultimate end user and their cost center can be crucial to a
successful installation later. The advantages of this centralized asset management view
(whether a system or a set of practices) at this stage of the lifecycle are:
➢ Inserts the redeployment process at the proper place in the lifecycle to prevent
unnecessary purchases
➢ Builds a record that is focused on the individual asset as it will be needed for
managing the life of the asset, not managing the order
➢ Allows a “holistic” view that combines the requested software and pieces of
hardware that can be part of a single request and yet may be filled by more than 
BP2
24
one business activity (multiple POs, different vendors, assignment of existing
licenses, etc.)
The installation process requires the linked information of the details of what is to be
delivered and to whom. In the ideal system, a status change from “on order” to
“received” would trigger the creation of a help desk incident or ticket with the
important information. This incident (or work order) would rarely have the serial
number information, but if available through system integration, it makes sense to
populate this information into the Help Desk system for future reconciliation efforts. In
any case, help desk incidents are the usual path for gaining access to the technical
resource team that can deliver and configure a new system, the two main aspects of an
installation.
Whether software is delivered on the equipment, imaged by the technical resource, or
delivered via packet from a software distribution product, the equipment and the
associated assets must ultimately be delivered to the correct location and person. Since
ticket closure times are a critical factor in how Help Desks are judged, the technical
resource person usually closes the ticket as soon as the task is completed. If the
installation went well, defined as all information was correct and the equipment
functioned properly, the closure of the ticket is the only action that must be taken. For
the process to be complete, however, the installation process must continue and
describe how to handle defective equipment, incorrect locations and any other
problems encountered. It is these exceptions that provide the reason for system
integration and it is at this point that information goes BACK to the asset management
practice or system. Discovery tools can uncover what is actually there, but they cannot
tell you what is supposed to be there and with whom. The capturing and confirmation
of this same data as the end product of the installation provides the first building blocks
of information for that ownership view.
MOVES
For the Program Manager, the physical movement of equipment can wreak havoc with
the accuracy of even a carefully maintained asset database. Some organizations with less
mature asset management practices attempt to use discovery data to create the asset
management view, avoiding the tracking of movement. Discovered asset data can easily
give a snap shot update on the assets that are actually in the environment. This 
Program Management Process
25
simplified approach loses the ownership view of the data that has already been built via
earlier process automation and integration to legal information. The use of discovery
data creates a hole in the processes where assets can be lost. The issue is particularly
difficult to solve for assets that are not reported by discovery tools (non-networked
equipment, some printers, and other types of assets)
Any process that includes a lot of asset movement and the use of personnel that it takes
to move desktops and servers, suffers from the twin problems of high error rate on the
data collected and high costs from the time involved. Reducing the error rate on
recording the movements introduces the system aspects again, while the cost of the
personnel emphasizes the need for speed in this activity. Solutions include hand held
devices and web front ends for recording the execution of the move. In a mature asset
management system, updates are subsequently made from the Help Desk repository to
the asset management repository so that any financial and legal responsibility shifts are
recorded in that master repository.
Move procedures must be able to handle a single move as well as major corporate or
departmental moves. Large moves utilize the facilities or property management team as
another source of expertise and potentially for data or systems that can be of use to the
asset management practice. Organizations that have great fluidity in staffing (such as
outsourcing companies with projects) may have invested in resource planning tools that
provide information on resources down to the desktop level, perhaps even including
floor plan diagrams. The Program Manager should include an analysis of these tools in
the life-cycle development project.
ADDS AND CHANGES
The addition of a video card or the replacement of a hard drive are examples of adds
and changes. These events are recorded in the Help Desk system and represent an
important set of processes for the life of an asset. The debate arises on how much of
this information should be recorded in a reportable way, and that it is not cost
prohibitive. From an asset management perspective, there are several reasons why this
level of data can be valuable.
Analysis activities are hampered without this data shown in at least summary form. A
summary of service by type of equipment and type of service is a key component in
determining the real cost for continuing to use an older piece of equipment. It is 
BP2
26
commonly assumed that it saves money to continue using an older piece of equipment
as long as possible. When the true costs of maintenance such as these adds and changes
are analyzed, the financial impact of continued use may be quite different than expected.
Another analysis tool that shows benefit from this data is the manufacturer reliability
evaluation.
For leased equipment, if may be necessary to return the equipment with the same
configuration as it had been received. A history of the changes made to the machine
during use can help reconstruct the original configuration. In some cases, the help desk
system may not be able to handle this type of reporting, either because the data is kept
in ticket form or associated with the user, not the asset.
As a final point on the value of tracking adds and changes from an asset management
perspective, some of the changes or adds that are made to an asset represent
equipment that are of significant value and may be tracked as assets themselves.
WORKING WITH THE HELP DESK
The Help Desk system is an excellent place for the Program Manager to turn to gather
IMAC data. Processes can be built to ensure that this data is collected in a way that can
be extracted from the Help Desk system and perhaps integrated with an asset
repository. An alternative approach is to utilize a discovery tool to keep track of
changes to hardware configuration. The lifecycle process automation can be developed
with the discovery data as the watch on configuration and its changes rather than using
the Help Desk data. This approach can be less expensive, but typically does not provide
the analytic data needed to support decision making. Another issue is that the tool
does not maintain an initial configuration for leased tools. In this section, the types of
tools and resources available in a Help Desk are reviewed as both a contributor to
hardware asset management and a beneficiary of the information developed through
asset management.
HELP DESK TOOLS
Whether the Help Desk is outsourced or staffed by employees of the corporation, a set
of software tools are generally used to conduct the business of the Help Desk. As
mentioned previously, help desk applications have extensive functionality for managing 
Program Management Process
27
incidents of service including extensive reporting. The database of the help desk
application generally maintains historical incident data. A knowledge base is often a
separate, but related application, providing diagnostic questions and answers to the
most common questions fielded by the Help Desk. Other tools in the Help Desk
arsenal can include a remote control application that allows technicians to take action as
if they were seated at the user’s computer as they work from their own desks. Access
to configuration management tools, discovery tools and software distribution tools are
common, either as independent tools or integrated to the Help Desk application. The
same bar coding technology can be used by technicians delivering service as was used to
receive an asset or to perform a physical inventory. With access to these tools, the
Help Desk staff focuses on maximum productivity for the end user and for their
technical resources as well. Many of these same tools play an important part in IT asset
management, creating an area of overlapping interest with different goals that the
Program Manager must understand and use to best advantage for the corporation.
Coordination between the Help Desk and the Hardware asset management is a
recommended, essential activity, although this coordination can have many successful
approaches based on the tools, skills, needs and politics of the corporation. It is
recommended that the Program Manager at minimum evaluate coordination with the
Help Desk regarding education, lifecycle process development and IT Framework
implementation projects.
EDUCATING THE HELP DESK
The Help Desk staff is a prime recipient for training on the asset management aspects of
policies. As the front line to the end users and therefore to their assets, the Help Desk
perform many of the procedures inspired and directed by policy. Understanding the
“why” of the policy and communicating that understanding to the end user can be the
best method for gaining widespread compliance.
The Program Manager can also provide background on the contractual aspects of assets
that impact how the Help Desk staff performs their jobs. Information on warranties,
licenses, leasing and maintenance contracts are all relevant to the daily activities of the
Help Desk. 
BP2
28
LIFECYCLE DEVELOPMENT
In addition to designing IMAC processes for asset management purposes as well as
delivery of service, the Program Manager has to look at what data would be of value to
the Help Desk as well. Asset management practices link contractual information with
specific assets. The Help Desk can use that information to determine the types of
services that should be delivered. Is the asset under warranty? Is it a leased asset? Is
there a maintenance contract in place? Whether this data is populated into the help
desk software or access is given to an asset management repository, either way the
corporation stands to gain significant savings from delivering the correct service.
Examples of the types of statistics that can enhance an evaluation are:
➢ Percentage of assets that received maintenance while under a maintenance
agreement
➢ Number of assets by type and manufacturer that underwent maintenance events
in a given period
➢ Percentage of assets touched by any process (move, repair etc.) by process
type, asset type and by month/quarter
The advantages of data integration between the Help Desk and asset management may
lead to integration projects or to the purchase of products with cross over functionality.
There are many choices here with very different price tags. The best practice
recommendation is to integrate the processes and to focus on providing needed
information to each group as efficiently and accurately as financially feasible. Analysis of
services, assets and performance should be considered as well when deciding on the
data to be integrated. It is important to remember that the Help Desk may have access
to a broader range of assets than any other one source of data, such as telecom and
non-networked assets.
Policy Management
29
INTRODUCTION TO POLICY MANAGEMENT
Having appropriate and correct policies defined is a critical success factor for any IT
Asset Management program. Policies need to be clearly defined, understandable
and enforced. As a best practice, IAITAM has identified more than thirty policy areas
that relate directly to IT asset management and must be defined for any organization.
Once defined, the policies must be accessible and presented in a way that employees
can readily understand exactly what is required of them, and why it is beneficial for the
organization.
Best practice policy management dictates that policies must be enforced. Therefore,
part of the transformation that must take place is that policies are uniformly enforced,
and non-compliance results in specific consequences. This will ultimately lead to
reduced risk of non-compliance and better protection of both the individual and the
organization.
Lastly, policies must be managed. Periodic review and updates to policies are
necessary to reflect new industry practices, technological advances, compliance
requirements and security risks. Policies should reflect the current state and structure
of the organization at all times.
In this topic we will address the following:
➢ Definition of a policy
➢ Why policies are a key underpinning of any change initiative
➢ How policies relate to IT Asset Management
➢ Best practices for managing policies
➢ Core processes for policy management
Chapter 2
POLICY MANAGEMENT 
BP2

➢ Who should be involved in developing and maintaining policies
➢ Best practice recommendations for policy concepts that are important to IT
Asset Management
➢ Practical approaches and techniques for managing policies
DEFINING POLICIES
Policies specify what needs to be accomplished, who is responsible for performing
specific activities, and explains why a given task needs to be accomplished or addressed
The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a policy as “a definite course or method of
action selected from among alternatives, and in light of given conditions to guide and
determine present and future decisions; a high-level overall plan embracing the general
goals and acceptable procedures especially of a governmental body.” Within some
organizations, policies are also referred to as directives. Whichever terminology you
use, policies or directives are written instructions that specify what behaviors and
actions are permissible and expected within your organization and designate those who
are authorized to perform them. These documents serve to guide, govern and even
prohibit specific activities.
DEFINING PROCEDURES
While policies dictate the what, who, and why, Procedures specify how a given task
should be performed through direction or guidelines so that specific activities can be
carried out often in the form of a checklist or step-by-step instructions.
Procedures are the exact instructions on how to accomplish a task. With fluctuations in
people, organizations, duties, opportunities and improvements, procedures often are
quite dynamic.
Have you ever seen the phrase “according to the policies and procedures documents
that…”? This is so commonplace that we feel it important to distinguish between the
two. A procedure is a specific sequence of activities that are performed to accomplish
an outcome or goal. Exactly what steps are to be taken to complete the given task?
Policy Management
31
The review and approval process for these two different entities often requires different
decision-makers and levels of authority. So, when structuring a policy, it is a best
practice to separate procedures from the policy document itself. Policies are more
general statements of intent. Policies do change and must be a revised from time to
time, but the rate of change is typically much less than for a procedure document.
Procedures are very much an important part of a Process, yet procedures are very
specific to the goals of each organization. As such, we will focus almost exclusively on
the specifics of policy building, with very little information covering specific procedures.
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE POLICY PROCESS AREA
While there are countless valid answers to this question, just imagine any organization
that does not have a proper policy base in force. There would be no governing rules or
regulations for the members of the organization to follow, or by which to be directed.
In essence, there would be general chaos allowing everyone to take the direction that
they feel is best. No structure, no guidelines; an obvious and direct path to the
inevitable demise of the organization.
WHY AND HOW THIS AREA RELATES TO IT ASSET MANAGEMENT
Just as all effective business is conducted on a base foundation of policies; IT Asset
Management must also utilize policies to achieve set goals. All the same rules apply, due
to the fact that the IT department is in fact a business entity that is regulated and
directed by policy. It is the duty and responsibility of the IT Asset Manager to act as
one of the entities that together with other organizational leaders will collectively
initiate, enact, and enforce the policies for the betterment of the organization. Policies
specific to ITAM will also need to dictate:
➢ Expectation of Privacy
➢ Acquisition of IT Assets
➢ Use of Employee-Purchased or Owned Software
BP2
32
WHY POLICIES ARE IMPORTANT
As stated earlier, policies are a key underpinning of any change initiative. All changes
are meant to be calculated, defined, and should provide overall benefit. Policies need to
institute:
➢ Control
➢ Influence
➢ Ability to cope
IMPLEMENTATION GOALS FOR MANAGING POLICIES
IAITAM has defined three core goals as part of the best practice for policy management:
➢ Effective implementation, including awareness
➢ Uniform enforcement
➢ Periodic review and update
Once Policies are Implemented
Setting policies is not an overnight activity. You will have to take into account the
environment, including organizational and cultural expectations, management
communication techniques, physical infrastructure, the processes you intend to cover,
and the ability of the enterprise to follow-up. An effective policy management discipline,
like an effective project plan, must begin with a scope statement covering the
operational expectations of the policy or procedure in question. Clearly defined,
understood and enforced policies are a critical success factor for a proactive ITAM
program.
GOAL 1: REQUIRED IT ASSET MANAGEMENT POLICIES ARE EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTED
With existing guidelines, and all future policies that may be implemented, it is imperative
that:
➢ Employees understand their responsibilities
Policy Management
33
➢ Employees understand why it is beneficial for the organization
➢ Policies are visible
By knowing the full range of what is expected, the:
➢ Employees can limit their violations
➢ Employees can recognize when others are in violation of policies
➢ Employees understand how to report and respond to recognized violations of
policy
GOAL 2: POLICIES MUST BE ENFORCED
Policies must be enforced throughout the chain of command in a way that is:
➢ Uniform across the organization
➢ Clearly evidenced through consistent, demonstrable consequences for noncompliance
By enforcing all set policies, the organization ensures that:
➢ The risk of non-compliance is reduced
➢ Negotiation potential is increased in non-compliance issues, as well as other
legal situations
➢ The organization and individual employees are protected
GOAL 3: POLICIES ARE REVIEWED AND UPDATED PERIODICALLY
Just as policies are written for a cause, the inevitability of policy change is ever present.
Though few well planned policies are just eliminated, there are times when policies must
be amended to suit the needs of the organization. Each policy change is founded by
specific reason. A few examples for the need for policy update might include:
➢ Industry trends and changes need to be accommodated
➢ Technological and legislative changes are addressed
➢ Changes in company environment are addressed
BP2
34
It is understood that policy changes are for the overall betterment of the organization.
Each change will have a specific impact on some function of a related process. For the
IT Management team, a policy change would most likely equate to:
➢ New compliance factors being better understood and thereby better mitigated
CORE PROCESSES FOR EFFECTIVE POLICY MANAGEMENT
TEAM BUILDING
We use the term “team building,” because it is often a process of gaining understanding,
consensus, and ultimately support in terms of champions who will own the policy effort
going forth. In order to begin this process, consider the following questions that should
be asked during the effort to define ITAM policies.
➢ Who should be involved in developing and maintaining policies?
➢ What are best practice recommendations for policy concepts that are
important to IT Asset Management?
➢ Can we identify practical approaches and techniques for managing policies?
IMPLEMENTING A POLICY (NEEDS-ANALYSIS)
As in all projects, an effective manager must conduct a needs-analysis to ensure that the
enterprise identifies and clarifies the specifics of the policy or procedure that is being
considered. Once a need is validated, the enterprise must determine if control
processes can effectively be put in to place through a specific policy or a procedure. If
the need is valid, then a representative individual or team must be identified, assembled
and empowered to address the issue.
At this step, it is critical to research if the policy or procedure already exists, or has
existed in the past, within the enterprise. Research should include determining how the
proposed policy or procedure integrates with existing documents both within and
outside the organization. How will the new guideline be accepted by the enterprise
culture? Research should include outside vendor sources concerning policy guidelines if
they are available and viable for the specific need at hand. 
Policy Management
35
REVIEW AND UPDATE POLICY
A team representing the involved groups can draft the initial documents. Members of
this “policies” team may include frontline managers as well as the strategic direction
team for IT. Policies teams typically include the people who will eventually execute the
procedure. Remember that in most working environments there are various cultural
groups that will be expected to adhere to standing and future policies, as well as
updated policies. Realistically, there will only be a few people in the organization who
are proficient (bi-lingual) enough with their language to draft an effective document.
Permit those people to do so, and then distribute the document across the enterprise
to determine its applicability. Once the drafts are prepared, distribute the document to
senior division leaders to determine how applicable it will be. After receiving review
input, move to the next step of modifying as many times as necessary to attain the vision
that was the foundation of the policy. The policy will be considered complete when a
general agreement as to the applicability of the document has been reached.
ENFORCE ALL POLICIES
Policies and procedures are of no value if they are not followed and enforced.
Effectively implementing policies requires a process of enforcement and verification. It
should be clear to decision-makers in the organization that the mere existence of
policies and procedures will not solve ITAM or SAM problems. All policies must be
visible, followed, supported and enforced.
FEEDBACK
A mechanism must exist for employees to register questions and suggestions about
policies and receive clarifications and explanations in a timely manner. A practical
implementation technique is to establish a service desk option for policy questions and
feedback where any and all policy related issues and questions are forwarded to the
policy owner for explanation and review, and within a defined time-frame (service level).
This technique allows for measurements and ability to capture issues as well as
requirements that may dictate a revision to existing policy or perhaps a new policy.
BP2
36
COMMITMENTS
Executive Management Approval
After policies have been deemed worthy of implementation, Executive Management
then approves the policies.
Organization Role and Authority
An organizational role and team are designated and given authority to implement the
ITAM related policies.
Policy Enforcement
HR and Legal have defined and agreed upon enforcement procedures and consequences.
Authority for Enforcement
Executive Management has designated policing authority for the enforcement of policies.
Awareness
Employees understand, acknowledge and accept policies, usually by means of a signature.
This is documented through employee sign-off annually (minimal annual sign-off). All
new employees and contractors are trained and then sign-off on policies as part of newhire orientation.
Understanding and Acceptance
Human nature dictates that people are most supportive when the benefits of compliance
are understood and accepted. The organization is committed to developing policies that
include rationale and benefits to both the company and the employee, in a way that
states not only the “what” but also the “why.” Employees must understand the
rationale and benefits of each policy. This is evidenced through understanding why each
policy exists, benefits that result from the policy and also the risks and costs associated
with not having or complying with the policy.
Policy Management
37
CAPABILITIES
POLICY INTEGRATION DURING MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
The organization must be prepared to handle integration of policies during mergers and
acquisitions.
ACCESS AND VISIBILITY
Policies are visible and readily accessible to all employees in the organization.
SAMPLE EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Any person violating any of the foregoing will be subject to appropriate disciplinary
action, up to and including termination. Moreover, the company reserves the right to
forbid the personal use of corporate IT assets altogether, by some employees or by all
employees, at any time, in the sole discretion of the company.
I have been trained and received the corporate IT Asset Management policies. I am fully
aware of the company’s IT Asset Management policies and agree to abide by the
policies. I understand that violation of any of the above policies may result in
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Self-Assessment and Action Planning
What is the most effective way for you to get started with Policy Management?
IAITAM has assembled the following policy assessment questions and statements to help
you determine the strengths and weaknesses in your organization. Our suggestion is to
conduct an interview with a number of individuals in IT, procurement, finance, as well as
the various end-user communities. Make sure to include contract employees or visitors
in the scope of your audit. The results will certainly be helpful in defining a focus for 
BP2
42
ongoing improvements. The following list should help as a guide to find the information
necessary to fulfill your self-assessment and action planning needs.
1. Review a complete list of all IT-related policies.
2. Review sample policies related to ITAM.
3. Determine who in the IT organization is authorized to develop and review policy.
4. Does executive management approve proposed policies?
5. Have the HR and legal departments defined and agreed upon enforcement of policies
and proposed consequences?
6. Do employees understand, acknowledge and accept policies?
7. Is there an ongoing process to ensure that employees understand and comply with
policies? How is this determined? Are spot-checks or surveys conducted? Is this a
planned IT audit responsibility?
8. What is the process for new hires to ensure understanding and acknowledgement of
corporate policy? Does this extend to contract employees, visitors and partners who
may have access to corporate IT assets?
9. Do corporate policies address the what, why, and when applicable, who? Review
specific examples to assure.
10. Do employees understand the rationale and benefits of each policy?
11. How are policy changes handled during mergers and acquisitions?
12. Are policies visible and located in one convenient intranet or binder location?
13. What do employees do if they have a question or concern regarding a policy? If
there is a question, how is it addressed? Is this performed in a timely and satisfactory
manner, from the employee’s perspective? It is very important for the Asset Manager
to satisfy the employee’s needs in this respect.
14. How often are policies reviewed and revised?
15. How is policy enforcement verified?
16. Is enforcement uniform? What consequences are applied?
Policy Management
43
17. What percentage of employees review and sign-off on policies annually?

INTRODUCTION TO COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION
The deployment of best practices for IT Asset Management will require many people
directly supporting the program, and strong backing from the entire organization when
it comes to awareness and understanding of set policies. Proactive change management
requires planning and communication for change, followed by the necessary training to
ensure that the adoption of these new policies are successful and that employees truly
understand how to use the new processes.
In the past, departments within the organization have been able to operate rather
autonomously, each department with its own function, directives and goals; not strongly
dependent on the other for the success of the overall business strategy. In today’s
business world, incorporation of departmental integration and cooperation is a
complete necessity. Imagine being an Asset Manager within an organization where there
was no set or automated process in place that would notify of new personnel and their
physical asset needs to conduct their jobs. How would you know what their needs
would be? More importantly, with specific needs communicated beforehand, the Asset
Manager will be able to prepare for, and meet all asset needs for the new employee
before they arrive. This is accomplished through inter-departmental communication. A
process of direct communication between all departments will help to streamline the
induction of every new employee. Today’s Information Technology has forced a change
in the direction of the “old style” business model forever. No longer can companies
exist without technology and integration. Managing technology across an enterprise will
be more challenging because you are breaking down the walls of archaic business
practices. The good news is that change is possible with a solid strategic plan that is
founded on communication and education.
Chapter 3
COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION PROCESS 
BP2
46
DEFINITION OF COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION IN ITAM
Communication is the process that by means of a commonly understood language,
information and ideas can be effectively imparted between entities.
Education encompasses the process of teaching and learning specific skills, tasks,
processes, etc. Education is also the imparting, and acceptance of knowledge.
PURPOSE OF THE COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION PROCESS
AREA
➢ Communication will facilitate the knowledge necessary to help others within the
organization to understand what needs to be accomplished for effective
management of an organization’s IT assets. Communication also helps in the
understanding of overall needs concerning others within an organization.
➢ When others are educated from the beginning in the need for ITAM, the
procedures set forth, and how it will afford positive outcomes, most people will
be much more positive about working for change, rather than to reject it. This,
along with communication, will make the employee’s job much more enjoyable
and will have a positive influence on the organization as a whole.
WHY THIS AREA RELATES TO IT ASSET MANAGEMENT
Communication and Education are key components to any IT Asset Management
program. By introducing an enterprise-wide policy of Communication and Education for
IT Asset Management, the following benefits occur:
With a Pro-active Planned Approach:
➢ End-users are taught, understand and follow the new organizational policies with
less resistance
➢ Executives approve and enforce the new organizational policies, creating buy-in
to the ITAM program as a whole
Communication and Education Process
47
➢ Human Resources has a clear and concise understanding of IT Asset
Management policies and are able to communicate those polices enterprisewide
➢ Legal has approved, and is able to enforce the policies
➢ The IT Asset Manager can enforce standards, track documentation, complete
forecasts and budgets, provide a higher quality of service to the organization,
and achieve a higher ROI on projects, etc.
With The No Action Taken Approach, IT Asset Management Without a
Communication and Education Plan:
➢ End-users do not know or understand IT policies. As such, there are no
references or guidelines to adhere to, causing confusion and more chance of a
non-compliance issue. With no program in place, chances of placing their
organization’s IT systems in jeopardy is increased
➢ Executives have not supported or approved policies, thereby causing a lack of
ability and buy-in to provide support for enforcement when necessary
➢ Human Resources does not have a clear or concise understanding of IT Asset
Management polices and therefore can not communicate them throughout the
organization
➢ Legal will have a hard time enforcing policies which are not well communicated,
acknowledged in writing, and when employees have not been properly educated
➢ IT Asset Managers will have less capability of enforcing standards, tracking
documentation, and less accuracy in completing forecasts and budgets. IT will
inherently provide a lower quality of services, expense project failures will
increase, and an overall lower ROI will be the standard
The examples shown above can be applied to any of the Process Areas within IT Asset
Management. The bottom line is that with communication and education, the
organization as a whole will operate in a more efficient manner. Your role as an IT
Asset Manager will be one of promoting acceptance within the organization rather than
one of opposition. 
BP2
48
IMPLEMENTATION GOALS FOR COMMUNICATION AND
EDUCATION
Communication and Education will be an on-going activity which will need to be
reviewed on a regular basis. IAITAM suggests that you have a cross-departmental team
available to plan and execute all Communication and Education events. This will help the
IT Asset Manager understand the needs and cultural environment of each functional
department. This will also provide support and an efficient way to measure the
effectiveness of Communication and Educational events throughout the organization.
Understanding the reasoning and justification for the Communication and Education
process is the first step to enacting an effective implementation program. Goal setting is
a logical next step in our process. Just like mapping a route from point A to point B,
establishing descriptive and well defined goals lends direction, and is such an important
part of any plan. Goals are the focus of what we want to achieve.
IAITAM has established three core goals as best practice for Communication and
Education:
➢ Education Planning
➢ Training Execution
➢ Communication Planning and Execution
GOAL 1: EDUCATION PLANNING IS CONDUCTED FOR EACH ITAM INITIATIVE OR PROJECT
Training provides education and empowerment. Planning for specific training is the
preamble and must:
➢ Base itself on the functional or knowledge requirements of the initiative
➢ Result in a formalized plan that defines required training for each role and
initiative in the organization
The desired end result of a well planned training program will help to ensure that:
Personnel have the necessary skills and knowledge to support the overall objectives of
the initiative
Communication and Education Process
49
➢ Time-to-value ratio is enhanced for each technology or process investment,
implementation, or change through out the organization
➢ The speed and accuracy of learning are maximized. Repetitive mistakes and
learning by trial and error are avoided
➢ Growth of each individual involved, and leverage of the profession are
maximized for all ITAM team members
GOAL 2: TRAINING IS CONDUCTED AS DEFINED IN THE ORGANIZATION’S APPROVED
EDUCATION PLAN
With the education planning stage understood and in action, it is now time to conduct
training sessions. With the proper tools, materials, and a proficient trainer, the
personnel will:
Receive the correct amount of training to support the success of the initiative
➢ Receive the training at an optimal time
➢ Receive the training through the most effective medium
After receiving the specified training, overall gain should include:
➢ A maximized ROI from the training initiative
➢ Achievement of Increased technical, analytical, and operational skills
GOAL 3: COMMUNICATION PLANNING IS CONDUCTED TO SUPPORT THE ITAM PROGRAM
Communication planning is the art and science of reaching the target audience.
Directed emphasis is placed on deciding how to best target that audience, and what
information supplied will be most effective. In essence, a communication plan must be
written in a way that:
➢ It is understood, approved, and supported by senior management
➢ Incorporates change in management considerations
Once the communications plan is in action, noticeable benefits should become evident
that include, but are not limited to:
BP2
50
➢ Employee buy-in, participation and pro-active support are maximized
➢ Risk of non-compliance issues is reduced through the lessening of negligent
actions or lack of understanding
CORE PROCESSES FOR EFFECTIVE EDUCATION AND
COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT
EDUCATION PLANNING
The first step in planning an education program is to examine the process and
information that is already in existence, and then determine the effectiveness of the
current overall program. Once the current education programs are evaluated, it is time
to identify the specific needs of your educational plan. After assessing current project
needs, compare those to the existing programs to determine what changes will be
necessary to achieve the desired goals. This will give you a baseline on the program
requirement and the enhancements needed in the educational programs. Industry
training programs should be identified and their credibility determined before choosing
an outside training program. Remember that training programs already implemented
within your organization have, for the most part, been tailored to meet the specific
needs of your environment. So always look closely at what is in use, and initiate the
arduous task of erecting a new program only when necessary. Identify the target
individuals within your organization who will require training. If training records have
been properly maintained, this task should be relatively easy to complete. When
identifying individuals in need of training, keep in mind that personnel within all
functional areas including executives, end-users, core team members and support team
members need to be considered. Training equates to knowledge, and that really does
apply to all ranks within the organization.
You should be able to prepare a cost-justification and benefit analysis for an educational
project once the following is completed:
➢ Needs analysis and requirements list has been established
➢ Individuals who need training are identified
➢ Training programs are selected
Communication and Education Process
51
➢ Value is assigned to the project
EDUCATION TRAINING ASSESSMENT
When establishing a new educational program, training of the employees is timesensitive, and a critical step in an ITAM program. Training too early can lead to a loss of
the knowledge gained prior to actually having the need for it, whereas training too late
can lead to a rushed implementation in the training program and does not allow for
adequate comprehension. In order to measure the effectiveness of the education effort,
a post-education survey and certification notice should be issued to all employees
receiving the training. This will allow you to quantify the effectiveness of the training
education program by the level of comprehension, thus producing measurable ROI for
the program. In addition, it is always advisable to have the same personnel complete a
critique of the instruction in general, training materials, instruction environment, trainer,
etc. Always allow the attendee to state their likes and dislikes about what they have just
been taught. This is valuable information that should be utilized for the betterment of
instruction.
COMMUNICATION PLANNING
Conduct an assessment of the current communication process to identify its
effectiveness. Next, determine the need for further communication based on the
current project. Establish a plan for the communication to take place throughout the
project, including the delivery model, who will deliver communications, how
communications will take place, who will receive the communications, the time frame
for communications, and the specific information that is to be communicated. This
seems like a large amount of detail and work in general, but the importance of every
planning phase can not be over emphasized. Whether the concern is training,
communication, building a sky scraper, or whatever; the fact remains that the planning
phase of every project is the foundation of the steps necessary to complete any given
project goal.
BP2
52
COMMUNICATION EXECUTION
With the planning phase completed, a written communication plan is then developed
and approved by senior management. Some examples of deliverables could include:
➢ Current status
➢ Milestones achieved
➢ Lessons learned
➢ Surveys to measure the effectiveness of the communication plan
COMMITMENTS
To be truly effective, total support must be afforded, and visible, across departmental
lines within the environment. Planning, implementation, execution, and assessments are
bound together as a functional process when the organization experiences full
commitment. Specifically:
➢ The organization is committed to the funding and execution of approved
training and communication plans
➢ Training plans are developed, justified, reviewed and approved for each project
➢ All Asset Managers adopt a training plan
➢ A continued practice of knowledge acquisition and program evaluations are
required to maintain current program levels, and to maintain awareness of
dynamic industry trends
➢ Senior management approves and participates in the execution of the
Communication Plan
➢ The Communication Plan effectively addresses policy awareness and
enforcement for all employees
Communication and Education Process
53
CAPABILITIES
What are the capabilities of your environment? Is there an appropriate training area
available? Does training have a sufficient budget? The specifics of capabilities are many,
and by no means are they completely covered by the brief list shown below. Some of
the more common capabilities do include the following:
➢ Training resources are identified and available to support the delivery of each
training plan. These may be an internal training team, vendor supplied training,
or a combination of both
➢ Adequate facilities are available or identified for employee training
➢ Educational partnerships and/or vendor relationships are created and used to
augment or substitute for internal training, as dictated by cost, quality and
timeliness considerations
➢ Change Management techniques and considerations are factored into all
communication and education training programs in order to address not only
what is being done, but why it is being done, and how each employee’s
contribution and awareness factors into the program’s success
➢ Define and execute management awareness, communications, and the education
plan
➢ Define, classify, and modify education and communication plans based on your
target audience
SELF-ASSESSMENT AND ACTION PLANNING
What is the best practice to enact an effective program of Communication and
Education Management? A solid start would be a thorough self assessment of your
existing program and environment. The following assessment questions will help to
establish the communication and educational strengths and weaknesses within your
organization. It is suggested that you conduct an interview with a full range of
individuals in IT, procurement, finance and the various end-user communities, making
sure to include outside contractors and involved visitors in the scope of your 
BP2
54
questionnaire. The results will certainly be helpful in defining the focus for ongoing
improvements to the Communication and Educational Process Area.
1. Does your management support the training necessary to perform in designated job
responsibilities?
2. Describe how change management techniques are factored into each initiative or
technology roll out.
3. Are incentives for new processes and technological improvements clearly defined
and communicated?
4. How visible is senior management in communicating initiatives and the reasons for
them? WIIFM? (What’s in it for me) WIIFMO? (What’s in it for my organization)
5. Are incentives provided for success in changing work needs?
6. Are there consequences for those who fail to support new initiatives?
7. How does your organization's cultural profile support change?
8. Are planned communications part of projects and initiatives? Are you able to site
some examples?
9. How are benefits communicated to enroll support in new initiatives?
10. Does the management team discuss specific initiatives with you?
11. If you have input or feedback on new initiatives or projects, do you feel that you can
provide that input, and will it be considered?
12. Describe your organization’s current learning strategy.
13. Assess how functional knowledge requirements are identified for ITAM activities
and the IT functional area in general.
14. Is there a preferred approach to gaining functional and subject matter knowledge?
15. Who is responsible for managing education requirements?
16. Review sample education plans.
17. Are training records maintained for each group or employee?
Communication and Education Process
55
18. Is there a process for creating and maintaining learning plans?
19. How is learning/training performance measured in the organization?
20. Are certifications required for specific roles and responsibilities?
21. Are there issues surrounding training?
22. What is the process for training approvals?
DEFINING THE REQUIRED CONTENT AND STRUCTURE
When defining a Communication and Education Plan, the curriculum should be tailored
to address the targeted audience. Each plan, depending on the project, will contain
slightly different content. Clear, concise content that explains who, what, where, when,
why and how is usually the most effective with any audience. When individuals are given
a clear understanding of what is expected of them and why it is expected, their
performance to task ratio will improve. The specifics on how to train or communicate
within your organization will be determined by the culmination of the information thus
far covered, further environment specific information that is discovered, and how well
that information is utilized.
MEASUREMENTS AND VERIFICATION EXAMPLES
Assessments, measurements and verifications are very similar in the way that they
provide information concerning what state the process is in at any given point, the
compilation of information for the betterment of the process, along with checks and
balances to ensure that progress through all phases of training are measurable and
verifiable. Listed below are some examples.
Measurements
➢ Employee Training Records and certification progress are periodically reviewed
to ensure accuracy, and to negate lapses in same
➢ Testing after training is an immediate indicator of information comprehension
➢ Surveys to measure the effectiveness of knowledge transfer and to measure
comprehension levels
BP2
56
Verifications
➢ Training records are maintained to verify adherence to the formalized training
plan
➢ Certifications are obtained where specified within the training plan

Project Management
59
INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT MANAGEMENT
A project can be described as an organized and managed set of activities that when
properly executed, results in the achievement of a unique and well defined product.
Such a work product is often referred to as a deliverable. Resources are mobilized and
deployed to perform the activities in a controlled fashion. A project is classified as
having a definitive start, and a calculated end. Therefore, a project differs from
recurring operational activities that may be performed many times repeatedly in a
typical corporate environment. In essence, a project can be characterized by the
following:
➢ A Project produces unique results or deliverables which are accomplished
through an organized and managed sequence of activities performed by qualified
personnel according to a finite schedule, with a defined start and end date
➢ The Project Management process area defines those characteristics of a project
team that are essential to successfully conducting the initiatives that are needed
to meet the goals of the ITAM Program
DEFINITION OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
The discipline of organizing and managing resources in such a way that those resources
deliver all the work required to complete a project within a defined scope, time, and
cost constraints.
PURPOSE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Project management is a method for managing a group of tasks, resources and people
for the purpose of a successful outcome of the project, where success is defined in the
beginning of the project.
Chapter 4
PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
BP2
60
WHY PROJECT MANAGEMENT RELATES TO IT ASSET
MANAGEMENT
IT groups have assets and they have people. The directed interaction between the
assets and people are considered tasks. For example, an organization hires 10 new
people, 2 in finance, 3 in marketing, 3 in sales and 2 in the call center. Each new
employee requires a PC along with specific applications needed to perform their job
functions. This scenario is repeated worldwide throughout all organizations. A project
plan for managing the deployment of the necessary assets guarantees that the process
can be repeated and achieve quality in each deployment.
A more complex project would involve the relocation of a remote office to the home
office. This may involve upgrading servers, adding disk space, changing network domains,
etc. The move is scheduled to occur over the weekend and the requirement is for the
relocated associates to begin work at 8 am the following Monday, without disruption.
This scenario is more complex and would greatly benefit from the exercise of creating a
project plan. Project plans will also be created to manage process improvement
activities suggested in these best practices.
PLANNING PROCESS
The Planning Process involves bringing together all aspects of a desired plan of action to
achieve a specific result, utilizing a commonly understood and unified process of events.
Identify resources needed
➢ Determine the resources necessary for the term of the project. Are those
resources immediately available? If not, what is involved in obtaining them, and
how long will it take? This must all fit in to the time allotted for the project
Allocation of resources
➢ After defining the necessary resources, determine how they will best be used to
accomplish the project goals
Estimate cost
➢ The cost estimate is going to be dependent on many factors specific to the
project. For generalities sake, project staffing often constitutes the bulk of the 
Project Management
61
cost. A detailed project schedule can be created using one of many estimating
tools such as Microsoft Project to estimate labor costs. Other factors would
include using historical data, vendor quotes, maintenance and service records,
parts data, etc. Allow a buffer for the unexpected. A cost estimate might even
be used in part as a feasibility study
Estimate project duration and dependencies on other projects
➢ Time frames and how this project will affect and/or inter-relate with other
projects must be considered. Once again, estimates will be based on the
specifics of the project variables. A two year project will not work for a one
year time frame
Project initiatives
➢ Identify all team members including – program manager, project manager,
project sponsor
➢ Declare project purpose & criteria for success
➢ Business purpose of project
➢ Identify roles in project
IMPLEMENTATION GOALS FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT
IAITAM has defined three core goals as part of the best practice for Communication
and Education:
➢ IT Asset Management initiatives are planned
➢ IT Asset Management initiatives are monitored and controlled
➢ Project Stage Reviews and Closure Activities are conducted
Project Management is the first step to a more mature IT Asset Management
organization. The good news is that project management has been a practiced discipline
for some time and there exists a multitude of tools available to assist in creating and
maintaining project plans. The bad news is that there is a multitude of tools out there to
choose from. The primary objective is to adopt the project management discipline so
that all IT projects are managed appropriately. Depending on the IT group’s experience, 
BP2
62
project management should be rolled out in a controlled fashion along with the
education of the practitioners
IAITAM has established three core goals as part of the best practice for Project
Management:
GOAL 1: IT ASSET MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES ARE PLANNED
The initial ground work is laid for the project to proceed. During this area of planning,
ensure that:
➢ A project is formally defined through a Project Charter during the Project
Initiation stage
➢ An executive sponsor and project stakeholders are identified
➢ Proven techniques are used to estimate project costs, project schedules and to
prepare a budget for the project
While writing the Project Charter, the roles, stakeholders and project objectives must
be well defined. In addition, ensure that:
➢ Necessary resources and funding are identified and committed prior to project
commencement
➢ Risks are assessed and mitigated
➢ Critical success factors, assumptions and constraints are identified and
addressed in the plan
➢ Quality requirements are accommodated
➢ Project success is optimized through full and complete planning
GOAL 2: IT ASSET MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES ARE MONITORED AND CONTROLLED
The Project Manager must maintain strong control of the project through all phases.
Effective ways of achieving this is to:
➢ Employ frequent and clear communication to the project team, sponsor and
stakeholders
Project Management
63
➢ Provide an understanding of the project progress, by comparing actual project
progress to the planned schedule, budget and quality requirements
➢ Ensure that all issues are escalated and resolved
Since most projects are a team effort, the importance of effective and timely
communication can not be overstressed. The team’s inputs will help the Project
Manager ensure that:
➢ Appropriate corrective actions can be taken when project performance deviates
from the plan
➢ Changes in scope can be managed
➢ Project adherence to original objectives is maintained
GOAL 3: PROJECT STAGE REVIEWS AND CLOSURE ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED
Project reviews are very important to the progress of a project in that reviews will
catch issues in a timely fashion, allowing the Project Manager to:
➢ Address process issues that occurred during the activities
➢ Address causes of defects
➢ Quantify the success of the project objectively in comparison to the planned
goals and objectives
In addition to the immediate benefits of review information, closure activities will
include everything learned along the way. The goal is that:
➢ Corrective actions and process modifications are identified for future use and
can be implemented
➢ The organization continues to learn and adapt
➢ Statistical project metrics can be communicated and analyzed
CORE PROCESSES FOR EFFECTIVE PROJECT MANAGEMENT
IT Asset Management initiatives are planned
BP2
64
Using Project Management principles, a project plan is created for the implementation of
an ITAM initiative. The plan identifies resources, people, tasks and schedules. The
planning initiative also employs risk management principles. The costs of the effort is
estimated and presented for a final go or no go decision. The timelines must include
major milestones to assess the project’s progress. The plan must also include all
dependencies on outside resources such as asset acquisition and involvement from IT’s
internal customers. IT and the department heads representing the internal customer
group must sign-off on the plan.
IT Asset Management initiatives are monitored and controlled
The frequency of reporting the project’s status is dependent on the size of the project,
the risks and the impact on the external groups. The larger the project is, the greater
the need for more frequent status reports. The more visible the project is within the
organization, the greater the need for layered status reports (reports for department
heads differ from reports for the executive team). Risks should be continuously
monitored and appropriate actions taken when needed. Schedule and cost must be reevaluated during each status reporting period.
Project Stage Reviews and Closure Activities are conducted
The milestones defined during the planning stage are used to gauge the progress of the
project and are most visible to the rest of the organization. The status of a milestone
should be reviewed with the organization and specifically the stakeholders. At project
close, a complete analysis is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the original plan,
the effectiveness of the implementation and the results of the implementation as seen by
the customer. Schedule and cost over/under runs are calculated against the original plan.
The effectiveness of the project planning is measured by the accuracy of the original plan
at the end of the project. The analysis will provide the IT group with the data necessary
to make improvements in the project management discipline.
Commitments
➢ The organization expects and supports a formal approach to project
management
➢ The organization identifies and assigns project managers with the appropriate
level of experience, training, and leadership abilities to ensure project success. 
Project Management
65
➢ The project manager must be able to apply leadership and communication skills
in a way that motivates and influences the project team and customers to work
towards a successful outcome
➢ Project team members are selected based upon the appropriate level of
experience and skills. Responsibility is assigned to those project team members,
authorizing them to perform the assigned tasks
➢ The organization identifies the appropriate level of training as part of a project
plan, and is also a critical success factor
Capabilities
➢ The organization understands and can perform Risk Management for all
projects. Risk Management is a process designed to identify and reduce the
threats to the successful achievement of the project objectives
➢ Stakeholders are actively involved throughout the project’s life-cycle. Evidence
of this can be observed through stakeholder activities, coordinated by the
project manager that include: reviewing actual progress as compared to the
original plan, resolving issues, ensuring continued commitments, mitigating risks,
and managing corrective actions until closure
➢ The organization employs project scheduling, estimating tools and techniques
➢ The organization maintains a project management method and continually seeks
to maintain and improve it. Although every project is unique, there should be
consistent methods, techniques, and processes identified that are repeatable and
measurable

PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANNING AND TRACKING EXAMPLE
MYTHICAL INDUSTRIES
PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEMPLATE
(Throughout this template you will see “<<Vendor>>”. These are meant to represent
your vendor of choice)
PROJECT BACKGROUND
Mythical Industries recognizes there is value in managing its IT assets. Although a
centralized asset repository has been created in our ERP system, the database is not
used by many IT support groups. The individual work groups maintain their own
spreadsheets and databases, which satisfy their individual business needs. In addition,
several of the individual work groups are investigating asset management tools, which
serve their independent needs. New requirements being generated by security and risk
management initiatives are dictating the need for consolidating and improving IT Asset
Management processes.
<<VENDOR>> is an industry leader in asset management practices and is being asked
to assist Mythical Industries in developing more comprehensive asset management
practices. <<VENDOR>> has developed a framework of IT Asset Management (ITAM)
best practices, based upon model specifications in several different process areas.
<<VENDOR>> will assess Mythical Industries’ current ITAM environment and practices
and create a roadmap with Mythical Industries to achieve the desired future state.
<<VENDOR>> will work with the Mythical Industries core asset management team to
organize the initiative and carry it through the activities defined in this charter.
A project charter meeting was held on January 2, 20XX to organize the project. The
following representatives participated in the meeting:
WITHIN MYTHICAL INDUSTRIES
➢ Software IT Asset Manager
➢ Hardware IT Asset Manager
BP2
68
➢ Project Facilitator
➢ Manager, Supply Chain Management
➢ Program Manager, IT Asset Management
<<VENDOR>>
➢ Vice President, Best Practices
➢ Vice President, Program Development
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The Business Objectives to be achieved are as follows:
➢ Ascertain the current state of the IT infrastructure asset management practices
as compared to industry (IAITAM) best practices
➢ Specify the desired future state and define the steps necessary to implement the
discipline of ITAM including new and re-engineered policies, processes,
technology, and resources
➢ Develop a business case necessary to understand the costs and benefits of such
new implementations
➢ The IT Security and Risk Management (SRM) initiatives are dictating a rapid
improvement in the manner in which Mythical Industries manages its IT assets.
An internal audit has identified a critical dependency for IT SRM, which gives
Mythical Industries the ability to identify hardware and software assets in the
environment with a predictable accuracy and certainty
➢ Concern about gross inaccuracy of IT asset inventory information has been
raised and must be addressed for Mythical Industries to be able to ensure that
all purchased equipment is installed and tracked, and in accordance with IT
governance and compliance controls
➢ Develop a comprehensive set of ITAM functional and data requirements for all
internal customers such as Network Operations, User Administration and IT
Service Desk and Desktop Technical Support
Project Management
69
PROJECT SCOPE
Currently, hardware and software accountability and business practices are distributed
throughout the organization. A broad definition of assets that includes any intelligent
devices or devices with an initial purchase price over $500 was used to provide a broad
boundary for the investigative phase of this project. Assets were not exempt from this
review, regardless of original purchaser, operating system, function, or current
responsible department.
Refinement of the asset scope will be evaluated in this project and recommendations
made for subsequent initiatives.
Geographic scope encompasses all of Mythical Industries’ locations. Available
information on some locations will be limited during the initial investigation due to time
constraints and historical autonomy.
PROJECT DELIVERABLES
This section defines the deliverables that are to be produced by this project. These
deliverables are defined in the Statement of Work and are repeated here for clarity.
1. <<VENDOR>> will provide Mythical Industries with a template for defining current
and future asset management practices.
2. <<VENDOR>> consultants will review a Mythical Industries developed description
of the current state to ensure that the description is complete, based on that
information provided to it by Mythical Industries.
3. Based on its analysis of the Mythical Industries’ current state, <<VENDOR>>
consultants will develop and deliver a detailed recommendation for Mythical
Industries’ desired future state. (the “<<VENDOR>> Recommendation”)
4. The <<VENDOR>> recommendation shall include a detailed description of the
steps required to move Mythical Industries from its current state to the desired
future state.
5. The <<VENDOR>> recommendation shall include a business case scenario to
justify the cost of implementing the new asset management processes necessary to 
BP2
70
achieve the future state, which may include the need for implementing new or
additional IT asset management tools and associated costs.
6. <<VENDOR>> will assist Mythical Industries in developing business and technology
requirements for identifying and implementing best practices for IT asset
management, conducting trials or evaluations of discovery tools and asset
management tools, proposing recommendations for discovery tools and asset
management tools based on <<VENDOR’s>> analysis of Mythical Industries’
current state; provided however, the decision of which of the discovery tools and IT
asset management tools to use shall be the sole decision of Mythical Industries, and
developing a framework of criteria that Mythical Industries can use to manage its
technology selection process.

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
1. The business case deliverable must be complete and compelling with sufficient
support to justify the investments to implement the ITAM recommended roadmap.
2. Recommended solution must be prioritized to meet the requirements set forth by
the information technology security and risk management team.
3. Recommendations must include a short term set of initiatives that will provide cost
savings in order to fund the continuing effort.
4. The ITAM roadmap must be viewed not only as managed portfolio of initiatives, but
also as a long-term strategy that continues to be evaluated through its benefits to
Mythical Industries.
5. Executive management must be committed to support the initiative. This support
must include commitment to policy development and enforcement.
6. The efforts must include a communication plan that effectively informs and
persuades all Mythical Industries personnel of the rationale and benefits that will be
realized.
7. An education plan must be developed to ensure that all involved personnel possess
the appropriate skills, knowledge and awareness of policies and can perform the
assigned responsibilities.
8. IT assets must be centrally managed. With the appropriate level of training and
planning, centralized processes and procedures can be performed within a
distributed organization and will result in a common set of information being
managed.
PROJECT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS
1. Scope and responsibility for IT Asset Management is currently not well defined in
terms of the enterprise. This scope must be documented and defined through
Mythical Industries’ policy and actively supported by Mythical Industries’ executive
management.
Project Management
79
2. Recommendations must take advantage of existing systems and processes wherever
possible and practical, e.g. existing ERP system, warehouse systems and HR system.
3. Financial impediments are significant in that budget constraints and cost savings are a
driving influence for the project and yet may restrict the choices for
implementation, or will at least impact the prioritization.
4. There are overlapping processes in place that will have to be consolidated and
changed in order to obtain the savings required from lifecycle management. Some
of the processes will be difficult to change, due to history, culture or scope of
authority. For instance, chargeback may cause issues for lifecycle process
compliance.
5. Significant efforts are underway within many business units of Mythical Industries
that may impact or be influenced by this project. It is a possible risk that an
expenditure of effort will hinder another business unit’s project goals because of the
speed with which progress is required. For this reason, organizational
communication through frequent meetings and information sharing must be a
priority.
6. Mythical Industries has historically placed an emphasis on tools and technology, with
the success of this project hinging on the incorporation of policy, process and
people changes as well as a systems approach.
CHANGE MANAGEMENT PLAN
This plan defines how changes will be managed throughout the life of the project. The
purpose of the Change Management Plan is to define a process that implements any
necessary changes that occur during the life of the project while managing and
maintaining control over the change. Uncontrolled changes during the life of the project
can be extremely disruptive. Lack of clear and effective process for evaluating and
tracking change requests, analyzing potential impacts of a change, and implementing
change can result in cost and schedule overruns and a failure to meet expectations.
Mythical Industries has a Project Management Office with documentation and processes
for conducting projects that should be referenced for ongoing initiatives. At a minimum,
an effective change management process ensures:
BP2
80
➢ Scope, schedule, and cost control
➢ Visibility of scope and cost changes
➢ Effective team communication
➢ Clear roles and responsibilities with regard to managing changes
➢ Effective interface to configuration management
➢ Consistent quality of deliverables and the meeting of customer expectations
➢ Consistent decision making regarding the implementation of change throughout
the life of the project
CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCESS
➢ The project team members will document the requirements for the change
➢ Assess the impact to the rest of the project in terms of scope, schedule and
cost
➢ Obtain estimates of the cost from the change if vendor or contractors are
impacted
➢ Change requested is presented to the project sponsor and stakeholders
➢ If approved by the Project Sponsor, the Project Charter and schedule are then
updated and communicated to all project contacts
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
The risk management plan provides a mechanism for the project team to identify risks,
analyze their impact and to plan on how to minimize their effect.
Risk Identified Analysis Mitigation

example, some
employees avoid asset

done as a convenience,
to avoid charge-backs
or sometimes even as
an act of defiance.

ELEVATOR PITCH
The project team developed the following elevator pitch:
BP2
84
The goal of the IT Asset Management Initiative (ITAM) is to build a strong program that
supports the entire life-cycle of Mythical Industries’ Information Technology assets.
We are focusing on the policies, processes and technology that the organization needs
to create a single ITAM repository, processes and discovery tools. This will help us
make better strategic decisions throughout the organization.
Our ITAM team has a critical role to play in reducing security risks, planning technology
upgrades and recovering from disasters.
We will gain a lot from managing and tracking IT assets, such as staying in compliance
with licenses and negotiating better deals with vendors.
The elevator pitch is a quick and understandable statement of information concerning
what the organization does. It is designed to impart enough information to invoke
questions from the listener. Example:
IAITAM provides knowledge and advice to the IT Asset Management
community around the world.
The statement is clear, precise and can easily cause enough questions to start a
conversation. Decide what your organization’s mission is, describe that in a brief
statement and see how it reads. The last step is to use it often.
SUMMARY
We have learned that Project Management involves the discipline of organizing and
managing resources to deliver all the work required to complete a project within a
defined scope, time, and cost constraints. That includes an organization’s personnel,
assets, resources, time and money. It could also include outside sources to help with
several stages of a project. Just remember that effective Project Management is founded
on a solid plan, a structured approach and a dedicated team to meet organizational
goals.
Documentation Management
85
INTRODUCTION TO DOCUMENTATION MANAGEMENT
The Documentation Management Process Area encompasses management capability for
all IT asset related documents throughout most of their life-cycle, from request, through
acquisition and onward. This discipline includes management of contracts, proof of
purchases, and all software licenses including certificates of authenticity (COAs).
Specific outcomes of a fully-implemented document management discipline include:
➢ Asset information and physical artifacts are maintained in a centralized
repository
➢ License compliance is assured
➢ Terms and conditions are defined and understood
➢ Status is maintained and reporting is available to support financial and strategic
needs
➢ The organization can recover from a disaster and continue its normal business
routine
➢ Configuration management for the enterprise is accommodated
By fully implementing the Documentation Management Process Area, the organization
will accrue the following benefits:
➢ Optimized financial controls
➢ Assured License compliance
➢ Accurate records available for audits on short notice
Chapter 5
DOCUMENTATION MANAGEMENT 
BP2
86
➢ Software license quantities monitored and matched to the required number of
users and information about the configuration of every computing device is
available for disaster recovery
Full implementation of the Document Management Process Area will have an influence
on the following business drivers:
➢ Ability to recover from disaster and/or widespread system failures
➢ Risk of non-compliance
➢ Ability to account for assets
➢ Ability to plan based upon detailed infrastructure knowledge
➢ Operational efficiency
➢ Reduced labor costs, increased support, IMAC and asset reconciliation
➢ Reduced software licensing costs
➢ Effective vendor management
➢ Reduction of maintenance and lease costs
DEFINING DOCUMENTATION MANAGEMENT
The act or instance of the supplying of documents or supporting references or records
for optimized accuracy and access to data.
PURPOSE OF DOCUMENTATION MANAGEMENT PROCESS AREA
Documentation Management consists of managing organizational documents throughout
the life-cycle of the document and supporting product. Documentation management can
include legal contracts, HR documents, licenses, Certificates of Authenticities, insurance
documents, support and maintenance agreements. Fixed-asset information is also
provided as an update to the accounting organization. Necessary data encoded on these
documents should be readily available through a centralized repository and also kept
offsite for disaster recovery purposes. 
Documentation Management
87
WHY DOCUMENTATION MANAGEMENT RELATES TO IT ASSET
MANAGEMENT
Documentation Management will be critical for all process areas within the IT Asset
Management program. Accurate and complete information from your document
management process can assist you in obtaining the information needed to have a
successful overall program.
DISASTER RECOVERY
The Asset Management Team will need to work closely with those individuals
responsible for the overall disaster recovery planning and testing functions in the IT
organization. The ability to restore system functionality is heavily dependent on the
ability to locate or reproduce master media, documentation and system configuration
information. In addition, if systems and software are permanently lost through disaster,
the ability to recover software proof of purchase documentation and licensing
information, not to mention all IT agreements will be key in preserving ongoing
compliance, without incurring undue additional licensing, research and cost of
renegotiation. Coordinate with procurement and legal on managing the terms and
conditions of all agreements.
IMPLEMENTATION GOALS FOR DOCUMENTATION MANAGEMENT
IAITAM has defined five core goals as part of the best practice for Documentation
Management:
➢ Asset Information is maintained in a Centralized Repository
➢ License Compliance is assured
➢ Terms and Conditions are defined and understood
➢ Organization can recover from a disaster and continue its business
➢ Asset status and reporting information availability
Documentation Management is a process which requires support from all areas of the
organization. When approaching Documentation Management, it is important to 
BP2
88
understand that you will not complete this task overnight. It is a series of small projects
starting with the current state of information, filling in the gaps with historical data and
monitoring throughout the future.
GOAL 1: ASSET INFORMATION IS MAINTAINED IN A CENTRALIZED REPOSITORY
An asset information repository is an extremely effective tool. Data can be input and
retrieved at any time from many locations, allowing:
➢ All asset information to be available to anyone with access
➢ Assets to be tracked and linked to contract, location, user and license
➢ Information, purchase order and invoice data to be immediately available
Additional benefits derived from a centralized repository include the following:
➢ Financial control is optimized
➢ License compliance is assured
➢ Accurate records are readily available during a compliance audit
➢ Software license quantities can be monitored and matched to the required
number of users
GOAL 2: LICENSE COMPLIANCE IS ASSURED
The importance of attaining and maintaining license compliance can not be overstated.
The asset information repository is a powerful tool that demonstrates:
➢ Proof of ownership can be confirmed
➢ Proof of ownership can be validated with a specific license at a specific physical
location
Having the capability of proving license compliance with ease will allow:
➢ Litigation to be avoided
➢ The cost of non-compliance to be reduced or eliminated
➢ The risk of negative publicity to be greatly reduced
Documentation Management
89
GOAL 3: TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE DEFINED AND UNDERSTOOD
Understanding license and contract specifics is imperative to maintaining compliance.
Information must be translated in a way that:
➢ Key terms and conditions will be entered into the IT Asset Management
repository for retrieval
➢ The IT organization can readily understand how each agreement permits the
license to be used and deployed; why, when and where
The better the organization understands the intricacies of each document, the better
the organization can:
➢ Manage documents in accordance with the terms of the license agreements
➢ Set up the system in a way that maintenance, support timeframes and renewal
events can be triggered automatically
➢ Utilize the capability of immediate contract reference and retrieval
➢ Renegotiate agreements based on definitive knowledge of what was previously
agreed upon
GOAL 4: THE ORGANIZATION CAN RECOVER FROM A DISASTER AND CONTINUE ITS
BUSINESS
In addition to the license and contract information entered into the repository, specifics
of asset systems are also stored to allow:
➢ Information about the configuration of every computing device to be available
for recovery
After a disaster, business can be fully restored using the information stored in the
repository. When a complete information package is available for every asset, retrieval
will allow:
➢ Restoration and business continuity procedures to be enacted in addition to
using configuration and license information maintained by the repository for repopulation
BP2
90
➢ A timely recovery following a disaster or incidence of physical destruction
GOAL 5: ASSET STATUS AND REPORTING INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE
Other attributes of a centralized repository include but are not limited to:
➢ The supporting of software and hardware life-cycle management
➢ Provisions for immediate or ad-hoc reconciliation of asset issues
➢ The availability of financial metrics and planning information
Further benefits derived from repository information are that:
➢ Reconciliation costs are reduced
➢ Asset planning information is readily available to support deployment planning,
purchasing decisions and financial planning activities
Core Processes for Effective Documentation Management
➢ Asset Information is maintained in a centralized repository
➢ License compliance is assured
➢ Terms and Conditions are defined and understood
➢ Organization can recover from a disaster and continue it’s business
➢ Asset status and reporting information are available
COMMITMENTS
The organization has committed to deploying and maintaining a centralized asset
management repository. This commitment includes the relational database repository
as well as the retention of physical records and media.
SECURE STORAGE AND DISASTER RECOVERY
Facilities have been designated and improved as necessary to house and retain all
physical records and documentation associated with IT Assets. Funding has been

documents related to IT Assets are retained in the centralized storage facility
BP2
92
BUSINESS CONTINUITY
➢ Business continuity measures for storage and recovery of all records (physical
and electronic) have been implemented and tested
SELF ASSESSMENT AND ACTION PLANNING
IAITAM has assembled the following documentation management assessment questions
to help you establish strengths and weaknesses in your organization. Our suggestion is
to conduct an interview with a number of individuals in IT, procurement, finance, as well
as the various end-user communities. Make sure to include contract employees or
visitors in the scope of your audit. The results will certainly be helpful in defining a
focus for ongoing improvements.

INTRODUCTION TO FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
The Financial IT Asset Management process area is a key part of your asset management
program, and also affects other departments across your corporate enterprise.
Financial IT Asset Management is the backbone to savings within your IT Asset
Management program from budgeting to invoice reconciliation. Financial IT Asset
Management includes many operationally recurring functions such as:
➢ Budgeting
➢ Fixed asset reconciliation
➢ Chargeback
➢ Invoice reconciliation
➢ Forecasting
➢ Financial audit preparation
➢ Billing
In addition to these, the Financial IT Asset Management discipline must support a
strategic view of IT spending. IT spending must support the overall growth of the
enterprise and should be optimized as such. This process area requires that baselines
are developed for each asset category and then continually reviewed for both cost
competitiveness and strategic fit.
STRATEGIC FUNCTIONS WITHIN IT ASSET FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT
➢ Conduct SWOT analysis of current IT Asset Management Financial
Chapter 6
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
BP2
102
➢ Establish and maintain IT spending baselines
➢ Conduct benchmarking to evaluate cost-competitiveness
➢ Establish IT Asset Management service levels
DEFINING IT ASSET FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
The process of managing IT Asset Financial information and data within an organization.
IT Asset Financial Management maintains cost controls, financial data, and budgeting
information for the IT Asset Management Program, as well as reconciliation processes
and financial audit information. The Financial IT Asset Management group should be
involved with any financial transactions for the IT Asset Management Program.
PURPOSE OF IT ASSET FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Financial Management is the discipline of controlling financial information and data within
an organization. Financial Management will give you baseline information on spending
which will enable you to quantify savings as you move forward through your IT Asset
Management Program.
WHY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT RELATES TO IT ASSET
MANAGEMENT
An IT Asset Managers ability to responsibly manage its budget and spend for its internal
customers directly relates to the Program’s credibility. Furthermore, it is the
responsibility of the IT Asset Management Program to maintain the financial records of
its assets for the purposes of compliance and cost containment.
IMPLEMENTATION GOALS FOR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
IAITAM has defined three (3) core goals as part of the best practice for Financial
Management:
➢ Invoice Reconciliation
➢ Enacting Chargeback Procedures
Financial Management
103
➢ Scanning all Invoices, IT Financial Records and Contracts into a Data Repository
This process defines the activities for managing the financial records associated with the
assets. The financial records include invoices, charge backs, contracts, etc. and how this
information is maintained in a repository. The reports generated from the recorded
information are defined as well as the repository queries.
GOAL 1: INVOICE RECONCILIATION
One of the easiest and most lucrative ways to save money in an organization is to
reconcile invoices. It is amazing how much money is lost to improper charges, double
charges, and for services on equipment that is no longer in use. The larger the
organization, the bigger the chance that money is being lost. For a complete
reconciliation, ensure that:
➢ All invoices are compared with all owner products
➢ All invoices are checked for accuracy
➢ All invoices are located or requested and procured
➢ All invoices are filed properly
➢ All Invoices are compared to the fixed asset list
Listed below are some of the benefits that can be derived from proper invoice
reconciliation:
➢ Owned products can be identified
➢ Over-billing can minimized
➢ Invoices can be located quickly
➢ All invoices are accurate when filed
➢ Both the invoices and fixed asset list match and are accurate
➢ Invoices are prepared, checked and filed properly in the event of a compliance
audit
BP2
104
➢ A report can be given to the IT Asset Manager to determine which products are
used or not used and a software pool can be completed
GOAL 2: CHARGEBACK PROCEDURE IS IN PLACE
A chargeback is another way of adding money to the budget. Instead of loaning assets
to other departments, a chargeback procedure needs to be instituted to allow a method
of charging an appropriate dollar figure to the departments that are using the assets.
Much like leasing to another department, chargeback will:
➢ Allow the cost of the product or service to be distributed among departments
➢ Allow accurate tracking of departmental spending on the overall IT budget
➢ Allow accrual cost plus maintenance and support to be accurately tracked
In addition to the benefits listed above, and an increased asset ROI, a functional
chargeback procedure will allow:
➢ Budgets and forecast to be determined accurately by historical data
➢ Departmental responsibility for spending, including maintenance
➢ All spending to be contained from a central source
GOAL 3: ALL INVOICES, IT FINANCIAL RECORDS, AND CONTRACTS ARE SCANNED INTO A
DATA REPOSITORY
Instead of searching endless physical files in countless different locations, the computer
age has allowed for the scanning process. When a physical document is electronically
scanned, access is centralized and allows:
➢ Invoices to be easily obtained in an electronic format
➢ Back-up copies of financial documents to be kept off-site
➢ In addition to the ease of accessibility that scanning provides:
➢ Records are located in one electronic source
➢ Purchases are based on past financials 
Financial Management
105
➢ Disaster recovery procedures of financial records are in place
CORE PROCESSES FOR EFFECTIVE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
INVOICE RECONCILIATION
Invoice reconciliation can be the leading hard dollar savings opportunity in the IT Asset
Management Program. Invoice errors occur in numerous areas: billing errors, doublebilling for products or services, maintenance and support on products which are no
longer in use, and support-level inaccuracies. Invoice Reconciliation can also be the
leading risk avoidance activity in IT Asset Management. The ability to locate all invoices
and reconcile against products in use will minimize exposure to compliance issues.
CHARGEBACK PROCEDURE IS IN PLACE
Chargebacks can help an organization that has separate departmental budgets by easily
tracking support, maintenance, and accrual cost of items within those departments.
Chargebacks allow for IT asset cost to be distributed across the departments within the
organization. This will allow departments to control cost and responsibility while
allowing spending and tracking from a centralized location.
ALL INVOICES, IT FINANCIAL RECORDS, AND CONTRACTS ARE SCANNED IN A DATA
REPOSITORY
Having a centralized data repository for financial records will not only save time locating
documents but will also serve as back-up copies which can easily be sent offsite in the
event of a disaster. A data repository will also help you with an analysis of past
purchases to current needs. For example, in the event of a compliance audit, electronic
copies can save both time and money in locating needed proof of purchases.
ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENTS
➢ Finance or accounting commits to participating in the ITAM Program
➢ A plan for archiving financial records is created
BP2
106
➢ Financial documents are linked to the asset
SELF-ASSESSMENT AND ACTION PLANNING
IAITAM has assembled the following acquisition plan assessment questions and
statements to help you establish strengths and weaknesses in your organization. The
objective is to create a process to record and to archive the financial records associated
with IT assets. The IT group will most likely need to interface with finance or accounting
depending on which one maintains the original financial documents.
1. How is the chart of accounts aligned with managed IT asset categories?
2. Describe reports that are available for understanding overall IT spending. Are
they flexible and do they allow for trends and differentiation of different asset
categories, locations, departments, etc?
3. Describe how budget owners are identified.
4. Describe how infrastructure spending is balanced with strategic investments.
5. What are the drivers?
6. How are the strategic interests of the organization communicated to IT?
7. Describe how IT is viewed by the Executive Management team (e.g. Cost Center
or Revenue Creation Engine).

Compliance Management
109
INTRODUCTION TO COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT
The Compliance Management area is the focal point for risk avoidance and audit
response. As part of this process area, the organization prepares a response to
compliance events, performs periodic internal asset discoveries, and ultimately settles
non-compliance matters.
DEFINITION OF COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT
The act of conforming, acquiescing, or yielding. There are three forms of compliance
that are impacted by your contracts: contractual compliance, operational compliance,
and regulatory compliance. All of them carry implications for business, legal, and financial
risk and your ability to manage that risk.
PURPOSE OF COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT
Compliance is adhering to legislative and regulatory guidelines. Compliance can range
from software to security of information. Compliance must be planned and executed
according to a series of established guidelines. Guidelines can range from contracts to
federal legislation to corporate or enterprise standards.
WHY COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT RELATES TO IT ASSET
MANAGEMENT
Compliance is an important part of IT Asset Management, and can be the highest risk
factor within an organization. Software compliance alone can have a devastating effect
on organizations, costing millions of dollars every year. Every industry has unique
compliance issues. Take for example; the medical industry has HIPAA, banking has
FDIC, financial compliance issues, and publicly traded companies have SOX. IT Asset
Chapter 7
COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT 
BP2
110
Management can be key to complying with legislative and regulatory issues. Technology
has changed the face of compliance in the last few decades, having added to the issue,
and has also supplied the tools necessary to resolve the problems that arise.
Compliance can be accomplished with careful planning, and continuing education.
IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT GOALS
IAITAM has defined three core goals as part of the best practice for Compliance
Management:
➢ The Organization Must be Prepared to Respond to Compliance Events
➢ Control Must be Gained over Assets
➢ A Software and Hardware Discovery Process Must be Enabled
Compliance Management is an ongoing activity which will need to be reviewed on a
consistent basis. IAITAM suggests that you have a team available to plan and execute all
compliance events. Having a team educated and prepared to respond to compliance
events will alleviate the risk to the organization. Understanding what you have to
manage and how to manage is a key component in Compliance Management. Having a
clearly-defined process for discovery will help you understand what you have to manage.
Remember: if you don’t know what you have, you can’t manage it.
GOAL 1: THE ORGANIZATION IS PREPARED TO RESPOND TO COMPLIANCE EVENTS
Having taken steps in preparation for compliance events, the betterment of the
organization is evident in ways that the organization:
➢ Is controlled, coordinated and proactive; not reactive
➢ Encompasses liability for the entire organization
➢ Negotiates the scope of audits to specific license types
➢ Is accurate and definitive in all possible measures
➢ Responds in a timely and efficient manner
Compliance Management
111
An organization that is properly prepared for compliance response has also earned
benefits such as:
➢ Costs and liability of non-compliance are minimized
➢ Negative publicity is reduced or avoided
➢ Business disruption is reduced
GOAL 2: CONTROL MUST BE GAINED OVER ASSETS
It remains completely true that if you don’t know what your assets are, there is no way
to control them. That being said, it is imperative that:
➢ All assets have been identified
➢ All proofs of ownership have been identified
➢ Verification of Certificates of authenticity for licenses, or media
➢ Purchasing and usage requirements have been identified and documented
The benefits derived from asset control would include, but are not limited to:
➢ The achievement of compliance
➢ The ability of being able to detect counterfeiting
➢ Inadvertent over-purchasing is avoided
➢ Each asset can be correlated with the corresponding proof of ownership
➢ Excess and/or shortfall information can be developed to support buy-up
purchase or asset removal
GOAL 3: A SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE DISCOVERY PROCESS MUST BE ENABLED
After gaining total asset control, a discovery tool must be utilized to find definitive
information about the assets that is necessary for over all continuity of asset
information. A discovery process will:
➢ Correctly identify software and hardware
BP2
112
➢ Encompass all IT Assets in the scope of the IT Asset Management initiative
➢ Function without undue performance impact to the organization’s network and
computing resources, as well as a much lessened interruption to daily routines
➢ Accommodate all remote and non-networked devices
Following a successful discovery run, a myriad of asset information is now at your finger
tips that will allow you:
➢ To perform accurate asset reconciliation
➢ To access readily available reports, and custom reports can be quickly produced
by exception accounting
➢ Asset management can now be performed on an exception basis rather than
conducting total inventory reconciliation.
➢ A minimized effort to perform recurring compliance activities
Upon Achieving Core Processes for Effective Compliance Management:
The Organization Is Now Prepared to Respond to Compliance Events
Control Has Been Gained over Assets
A Software and Hardware Discovery Process Has Been Enabled
Commitments of The Organization
➢ Legal and Executive management are part of the audit response team and are
prepared to respond to compliance events.
➢ The Audit response team has been proactively trained on the response process
Capabilities of The Organization
➢ An audit response team has been organized and empowered to conduct the
audit response process
➢ Access to an attorney with compliance settlement negotiation experience has
been established
Compliance Management
113
➢ The IT organization has implemented a discovery tool and has a process for
consolidating the discovery result data
➢ The IT organization has implemented a process and/or technology to enable
discovery of remote computing devices. A remote computing device could
mean devices such as laptops, smart phones and PDA’s, or devices that have
been assigned to home or remote locations, etc
➢ The discovery process supports tools that are configured to detect illegallydownloaded or otherwise obtained files such as video, mp3 files etc. A report is
available to identify and resolve occurrences of such theft
➢ A policy has been defined and communicated throughout the organization (via
the Policy Management Process Area) regarding receipt of and appropriate
response to audit requests
SELF-ASSESSMENT AND ACTION PLANNING
IAITAM has assembled the following compliance management assessment questions to
help you to establish strengths and weaknesses in your organization. Our suggestion is
to conduct an interview with a number of individuals in IT such as: procurement, and
finance, as well as the various end-user communities. Make sure to include contract
employees or visitors in the scope of your audit. The results will certainly be helpful in
defining a focus for ongoing improvements.

MEASUREMENTS AND VERIFICATIONS EXAMPLES
Measurements
➢ Trend/Exception report when viewed as process defects (where the process is
not working) versus all assets managed. Input to Six Sigma report.
➢ Review of periodic (mock) audit results for accuracy 
Compliance Management
117
➢ Results of audit activities and volumes are trended over time
Verifications
➢ The primary mechanism concerning the verification of the compliance
management process is the initial audit which establishes a baseline for ongoing
and periodic audits as well as implementation trends
RESPONSE TO COMPLIANCE EVENT
Event Notification
➢ Once notification of a non-compliance event is received, that notification must
be forwarded immediately to the designated corporate attorney. The attorney
then communicates the predicament to executive management and the
response team. The response team then contacts procurement representative
to freeze all order processes for any and all new software
➢ Determine whether notification is a legitimate audit request or an “Audit Threat
Letter” (Fishing expedition)
Acknowledgement of event
➢ Attorney makes initial contact to acknowledge receipt of letter and expresses
interest in working with auditor. Attorney attempts to narrow the scope of the
audit during a second call.
Preparation for the audit
➢ ITAM reviews most recent audit report
➢ ITAM reviews most recent excess / shortfall report
➢ ITAM reviews resulting buy-up and deletion records
➢ ITAM runs current audit report with discovery tool
➢ Purchasing / ITAM collects proofs of purchase, prepares proof of purchase
report and makes copies for attorney
➢ ITAM analyzes proof of purchases and reconciles against current audit report
BP2
118
➢ ITAM prepares audit report

121
CORE PROCESSES FOR EFFECTIVE LEGISLATION MANAGEMENT
➢ Know what current Legislation is that concerns IT Asset Management
➢ Keep abreast of proposed Legislation that will affect IT Asset Management
➢ Maintain communications with your Legislator concerning issues that will affect
your organization
ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS FOR LEGISLATION MANAGEMENT
To derive benefit from a thorough understanding of current and proposed legislation
which will better position your organization to:
➢ Achieve and maintain compliance
➢ Attain a stronger negotiations platform
➢ Add value by means of proper IT Management (avoiding fines, understanding tax
laws of different states, etc.)
INTRODUCTION TO LEGISLATION
The purpose of the Legislation Management Process Area is to help you learn to stay
current on legislation that will impact an organization in terms of non-compliance
threats and risks, thus allowing an organization to proactively adapt, prepare, and
respond to all compliance requirements.
DEFINITION OF LEGISLATION
The act of making or promulgating laws; a law, or a body of laws enacted by a Legislator
or other governing body.
Chapter 8
LEGISLATION 
BP2
122
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION PROCESS AREA
Legislation can include Federal and local laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances that
must be adhered to in order to avoid risk and/or potential penalties for an organization.
WHY LEGISLATION RELATES TO IT ASSET MANAGEMENT
Software is a copyrighted work of original creation which is covered under Title 17 of
the United States Code, also known as the Copyright Act. Disposal is covered under
legislation enforced by the EPA. Digital circumvention is covered under federal
legislation known as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). The list continues,
from procurement to disposal and everything in-between; and has some type of federal,
state or local legislation governing its usage. These legislative pieces are not always easy
to track or understand. Global enterprises have additional legislative doctrine issued by
countries that they engage into business with that will have to be investigated as well.
In this, the Legislation portion of the IBPL, (IAITAM Best Practice Library) many laws,
acts, and regulations will be covered that directly concern the IT Asset Manager;
domestically, as well as globally. In the Legislation Management Process you will see:
➢ An overview of the sub process areas and how they relate to this process
➢ How key processes relate to other key process areas
➢ The implementation of Legislation Management Goals
The main goal of IAITAM Legislation Management under the IBPL is that:
➢ An organization must to be aware of current legislation affecting all aspects of
its business
➢ An organization will gain many benefits from a firm knowledge of current
legislation
Legislation will need to be monitored and updated as existing laws are amended and
new laws are enacted. Monitoring proposed legislation will allow you to plan for
modifications as legislation is introduced. Two benefits of monitoring legislation would
include cost savings and risk avoidance. An example of cost savings could be a tax
reduction on purchases. Some states may not charge tax if electronic distribution 
Legislation
123
occurs. An example of risk avoidance can be as simple as the education of your
employees on what can, or can not be done with corporate equipment. The list is long,
and the advantages are great; If you know the laws.
ORGANIZATION HAS AWARENESS OF CURRENT LEGISLATION
In the dynamic world of Legislation, any organization simply must be aware of current
and forthcoming laws that will have a direct or indirect effect on them. By knowing and
understanding current Legislation, benefits will be derived in ways that will:
➢ Allow an organization the knowledge to prepare to avoid potential liability for
being non-compliant
➢ Protect the organization from unknown, non-communicated, or hard-to-find
legislation
➢ Provide the ability to take proactive action with elected representatives
Other positive attributes of legislative knowledge would include:
➢ The potential for liability being lessened, or avoided
➢ Not being caught off-guard by unknown, non-communicated, or hard-to-find
legislation
➢ Standard terms and conditions that are defined for the IT Acquisition Process
➢ A better understanding of the positions that are expressed on legislative issues
COMMITMENTS
Assign responsibility
➢ Responsibility is designated within the organization to perform the Legislative
Update Review and assess the impact of current and future legislation on a
company
Organizational policy established
➢ The organization establishes and maintains a policy to maintain awareness and
respond to legal requirements for compliance
BP2
124
➢ A legislative action plan includes establishing contact with representatives
Capabilities
➢ A resource has been identified with the skills, knowledge and experience levels
necessary to perform the activities within the process area
SELF-ASSESSMENT AND ACTION PLANNING
IAITAM has assembled the following legislative assessment questions to help you
establish an organizations strengths and weaknesses with respect to its legislative
management. Interviews should be conducted with individuals across all functional areas
including IT, procurement, finance, as well as end-user communities. It may be wise to
include outside contractors employees or visitors in the scope of your interviews,
however that is a strategic corporate decision not to be made lightly. The results of
these interviews will certainly be helpful in defining a focus for on going improvements.
1. Are policies and processes revised based upon knowledge of legislative changes?
2. Is someone in the organization responsible for maintaining awareness of legislation
that impacts the management of IT assets and compliance?
3. What action does the organization take to maintain its knowledge of current
legislation?
4. Does your organization actively promote change that is favorable to the industry?
5. Are responses or proposals communicated to elected officials to influence them?
6. Are standard terms and conditions maintained and updated, based upon awareness
of IT related legislation?
Verifications Examples
Review status with high-level management. A periodic review is conducted with highlevel management to communicate the impact of current and proposed legislation on
the business and for escalation of, and resolution to those issues. Proposals for issue
resolution or changes to organizational commitments are presented at this point.

Vendor Management
127
INTRODUCTION TO VENDOR MANAGEMENT
The Vendor Management Process Area defines attributes of maturity in how well you
are communicating with, leveraging and negotiating with your vendors. Structural
strategies for success include assigning vendor managers internally, who follow a
documented communication protocol and build a library of interactions. Business
strategies for lease versus buy options, outsource versus retain options, and global
consolidation are encompassed in these processes.
DEFINING VENDOR MANAGEMENT
Vendor management characterizes the process of leading and directing all or part of an
organization through the interactions with vendors.
PURPOSE OF VENDOR MANAGEMENT
Vendor management encompasses the policies and processes for interacting with the
vendors that provide the organization its IT assets, while ensuring maximum return on
investment and meeting all of the organization’s objectives.
WHY VENDOR MANAGEMENT RELATES TO IT ASSET
MANAGEMENT
Vendor management impacts several aspects of IT assets. One is the identification and
negotiating process to assure efficient and cost-effective acquisition of IT assets. It is also
important to rate the vendors based on service and quality of the asset. Furthermore,
sourcing assets from multiple vendors increases costs and jeopardizes the organization’s
quality standards of the assets and services provided by the vendors. Strong vendor
management also reduces the risk of obtaining invalid or illegal assets. Vendor
Chapter 9
VENDOR MANAGEMENT 
BP2
128
management is essential to the successful management of IT assets by ensuring the
organization’s sourcing is performed in a predictable and well-defined process.
IMPLEMENTATION GOALS FOR VENDOR MANAGEMENT
IAITAM has defined two core goals as part of the best practice for Vendor Management:
➢ The organization manages all communication with its vendors
➢ The organization builds and maintains relationships with vendors through an IT
vendor management responsibility
The vendor management policies and processes enforce standards on the organization’s
IT asset vendors. These standards include quality of product and/or service, price,
timeliness, and support. The vendor list is managed and each vendor is rated based on
the previous stated criteria.
GOAL 1: THE ORGANIZATION MANAGES ALL COMMUNICATION WITH ITS VENDORS
There is a shopping list of mandates that an organization expects from its selected
vendors. The IT Vendor Manager will ensure that:
➢ A complete history of transactions are maintained
➢ Rules and expectations are established and communicated to the vendor
➢ All interaction is coordinated with and goes through the IT Vendor manager
who is responsible for: meetings, letters, emails, phone calls, payments,
deliveries, transactions, orders, terms and conditions, pricing and discounts,
rebates and credits
Effective Vendor management will also ensure that:
➢ Vendor information is available and can be leveraged for the benefit of the
organization
➢ Inappropriate information is not shared with vendors that would damage
negotiating positions or divulge confidential corporate information
➢ Fair and ethical procurement processes are enabled
Vendor Management
129
➢ Expectations of vendors are clearly communicated
➢ Strategic aspects of relationships can be maintained
GOAL 2: THE ORGANIZATION BUILDS AND MAINTAINS RELATIONSHIPS WITH VENDORS
THROUGH AN IT / VENDOR MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY
Accountability holds the strength in the Vendor Management program. When properly
structured:
➢ All vendor communication Is focused through a single point of responsibility
➢ Vendors are identified and selected through a common functional process
➢ Master agreements with vendors are established
With carefully planned structure and full accountability, the Vendor Manager will ensure
that:
Required sourcing and contract information is gathered
➢ Open, objective communication is established
➢ Excellent relationships can be leveraged and sustained
➢ Maximum value to the business is obtained
CORE PROCESSES FOR EFFECTIVE PROJECT MANAGEMENT
THE VENDOR MANAGER IS TRAINED TO BE WELL VERSED IN THIS POSITION
The evaluation criteria and award process is defined and the associates responsible for
communicating with the vendor is educated on this process. Communication with
vendors is consistent and the vendor’s responsibility to the organization is clearly
communicated and understood by the vendor. Achieving the most from vendors comes
with experience, and the knowledge of how to best use that experience. Even the
newest Vendor Manager will learn quickly from every vendor encounter. 
BP2
130
THE VENDOR MANAGER LEARNS TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS
The process encourages building a relationship for the purpose of creating a partnership
between the organization and the vendor. Vendors appreciate being brought in to assist
in identifying problem areas within an organization. After all, it gives the vendor a close
up view of what the organization needs, and an overall better chance for the vendor to
offer appropriate products. This could also afford the organization benefit in that the
products offered could result in cost savings or improved efficiencies.
Commitments
➢ The organization commits to an IT Vendor Management capability. This may
take place in the form of an IT Vendor Management Office (VMO) or Vendor
Relationship Manager. The role may be assigned to individuals, such as the IT
Asset Manager, depending on the size and needs of the organization. Vendor
Management resources are identified with the right blend of IT financial
management, legal and/or contracting experience to assume the responsibilities
of this role
➢ The organization supports the ongoing professional development of the Vendor
Management personnel
➢ The organization empowers the IT Vendor Manager with the authority to
negotiate and manage all IT related sourcing activities and contract negotiations
at an equal or greater level than his or her counterparts
➢ The IT Vendor Manager is committed to and actively involves the IT Asset
Manager, Line of Business Managers and IT Technical Specialists in Vendor
Management activities
Capabilities
➢ The organization maintains a database of all vendors. The database is flexible,
and can track complex relationships. This is sometimes performed using a
commercial Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system
➢ Vendor records are kept meticulous, organized and easily-accessed by those
who require the information
Vendor Management
131
➢ A cross reference of all transactions and contracts to vendors is maintained and,
if separate, is interfaced to the ITAM documentation management system
(repository)
The organization anticipates and engages proactively in order to take advantage of
strategic opportunities with its vendors. Examples of these opportunities would include:
➢ Volume purchase agreements
➢ Vendor consolidation
➢ Discounting of services, support and or maintenance based upon specific
business commitments
➢ Fiscal year-end discounts
➢ References and testimonials
➢ Cross-marketing or joint marketing opportunities
➢ Relationships are built with vendors as strategic partners
SELF-ASSESSMENT AND ACTION PLANNING
IAITAM has assembled the following Vendor Management plan assessment questions to
help you establish strengths and weaknesses in your organization. The objective is to
create a process and policy for dealing with the organization’s vendors for the purpose
of ensuring quality services and products and cultivating a long term relationship
beneficial for both organizations.
1. A complete history of transactions is maintained.
2. Rules are established and communicated for vendor communication.

Process Implementation
The organization’s processes must be created and adapted to meet the goals of the IT
Acquisition process area. Process implementation should include the following
processes as a minimum:
➢ Vendor Performance Review Process
➢ Vendor communication process
➢ Vendor research process
Operational Activities
➢ Review IT project requirements
➢ Identify candidate vendors based on experience, previous relationships, and
independent research

135
➢ Provide input to the selection process for new vendors, including creation of
unique vendor identifiers and collection of required vendor information. (See IT
Acquisition Process Area)
➢ Periodic vendor performance evaluations. Initiation of communications
program and corrective actions
➢ Evaluation of situations for vendor consolidation versus competitive bidding
Inputs
➢ Communication Policy
➢ Request for Vendor Performance Information
Outputs
➢ Vendor performance information
➢ Corrective action report
➢ Vendor information and research (see: IT Acquisition Process)

Acquisition
137
Acquisition of IT assets rarely happens in a vacuum, especially for large acquisitions.
More and more, the IT group has been invited by other major functional groups within
the organization such as marketing or sales, and the asset is paid for by the group’s
budget. Therefore, IT’s acquisition process must instill confidence in the other groups
and must also interlace with the improvement process used by these other functional
groups. It is also more than likely that the IT acquisition process will force other groups
to adopt a more disciplined approach to their automation efforts, helping to define a
cross-functional team that will review this process and champion the IT group’s efforts
when deployment time comes.
INTRODUCTION TO ACQUISITION
The IT Acquisition Process Area is the gatekeeper for the application of all IT Asset
Management strategies determined by your organization, including policies, standards
and life-cycle processes. An effective IT acquisition process empowers the rest of your
IT asset program by applying process, determining pathways for exceptions and
generating the initial records for the IT assets before acquisition is even complete. The
goal of IT acquisition is to acquire the IT assets that are required by the organization, in
the most cost-effective and productive manner for the organization.
DEFINITION OF ACQUISITION
An asset or object that is purchased or obtained. It is the policy and process for
purchasing IT assets in a disciplined and predictive manner that is in line with the
organization’s business objectives.
Chapter 10
ACQUISITION 
BP2
138
PURPOSE OF ACQUISITION
IT Asset Acquisition Process empowers the IT Asset Manager to function in an effective
manner, while obtaining the best value of all IT assets needed within the organization. IT
acquisition includes requirements verification and selection criteria, formal product
reviews and selection, approval process and sign-off, vendor negotiations and contract
development processes.
HOW ACQUISITION RELATES TO IT ASSET MANAGEMENT
The IT Acquisition Process needs to ensure purchases are in line with the organization’s
IT strategy. Furthermore, the process needs to prevent purchases of duplicate assets
and to identify existing assets that can be redeployed. Rarely does an acquisition carry
with it a one-time cost. Total cost of ownership (“TCO”) must be considered. The IT
Asset Management Process supports the IT Acquisition Process. Asset acquisition drives
other IT processes such as the Asset Identification Process.
IMPLEMENTATION OF IT ASSET GOALS
IAITAM has defined five core goals as part of the best practice for IT Acquisition /
Procurement Process:
➢ Request and Approval process
➢ Asset Selection Process
➢ Negotiations Process
➢ Terms and Conditions
➢ Redeployment Process
GOAL 1: DEVELOP A REQUEST AND APPROVAL PROCESS
The development of an effective Request and Approval Process is an imperative step in
the progress to reaching one of the many asset management goals. The implementation
of this process will benefit the organization in such ways as to:
Acquisition
139
➢ Place the correct equipment on the user’s desk with minimum work
interruption
➢ Enforce the organization’s standards
➢ Provide an alternative process for exceptions
➢ Allow a path for redeployment
➢ Support leasing as an acquisition strategy
➢ Receive proper authorization with the least management involvement
➢ Ensure that the request history is kept current to allow for trending and
evaluation of vendors and choices
➢ Easily accommodate frequent changes in management or approval authorities
➢ Easily maintain asset choices
The Request and Approval Process also provides direct benefits that enhance many
aspects of the organization. Some of the specific benefits include, but are not limited to:
➢ Budget and cost center management is better supported
➢ Uniformity of assets is maximized to support redeployment, and cost savings
from reduced support issues
➢ Approved requests meet SLA-type service commitments
➢ Volume purchase opportunities are exploited
➢ Sourcing decisions made in the selection process are incorporated into the
choices available for requests
➢ Feedback is provided to Budget Managers, Vendor Relations Staff, and the
Contracts Department
GOAL 2: DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN AN ASSET SELECTION PROCESS
The development of an Asset Selection Process is a natural next step in the progression
towards achieving the five core goals. Knowledge of your organization’s asset needs is 
BP2
140
paramount in the proper selection process, and by applying that defined knowledge, the
selection process moves forward to benefit the organization in such ways that:
➢ The formality of the process matches the characteristics of importance to the
organization. Tools such as a simplistic Purchase Order to purchase off the
standard agreements, RFB, RFQ, Reverse Auctions, use of third parties, and
RFPs are all part of the proper Acquisition Process when used according to
criteria
➢ Incorporates a vigorous assessment of asset choices based on an established,
but dynamic list of characteristics
➢ Makes use of negotiated agreements already in existence
➢ Ensures purchases are made with full knowledge of any existing issues, including
customer satisfaction, high maintenance rates, and other information obtained
from the Vendor Management process area
➢ Reflects the long term IT strategic goals
➢ Represents best sourcing choice for the organization at any given point in time
➢ Coordinates with the service desk team to assess maintenance or service issues
➢ Identifies any issues for the IT environment from a technical and security
perspective prior to asset selection
➢ Trials or pilots are conducted where most beneficial to the organization
➢ Criteria including price, maintenance, expected life-span, mission criticality of
the asset, and electronic data specifications are all incorporated into the
information provided to the negotiating team
➢ Take advantage of the existing procurement systems and processes wherever
feasible
➢ Coordinate informational needs between departments (procurement, finance,
legal, IT, end department) as well as the vendor’s needs
➢ Data on ordered assets is collected and made available to procurement, ERP
and IT Asset Management systems
Acquisition
141
With the Asset Selection Process in place, newly defined asset opportunities begin to
emerge. Some of the specifics include, but are not limited to:
➢ The selection of a particular asset is balanced against the minimum standards for
new equipment and against the minimal acceptable standards that initiate
disposal
➢ Feedback on standards and updated vendor catalogs are provided to the IT
strategic planning function for observation and implementation
➢ The best deal is struck for the asset, based on organizational needs
➢ The ever changing industry and economic issues are assessed for their impact
on existing agreements
➢ Allowing for portfolio-type management to be an option
➢ Vendor consolidation goals are more closely met
➢ Measurement criteria for the vendor, the asset, and the process are all
facilitated by the data collected prior to acquisition
➢ The selection process considers all of the possibilities for best alternatives,
including new opportunities that may not yet be realized
GOAL 3: DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN A NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS
A strong, well planned and executed Negotiations Process is buying power. A well
seasoned negotiator will use all acquired skills to obtain the most value for the products
and services necessary to achieve all (or as many as possible) desired acquisition goals.
In the development of an effective Negotiations Process, some specific factors to
consider in order to achieve the organization’s goals are:
➢ Create repeatable steps to provide structure to negotiations
➢ The incorporation of previous experience with a vendor, including contracts in
place service and maintenance statistics, and customer satisfaction
➢ Negotiations are based on researched information and the development of
alternative paths; either for negotiation with the vendor, or in place of
negotiations with the vendor
BP2
142
➢ Directly reflects the organization’s specific “must-have” list for terms and
conditions
➢ An understanding of potential concessions and alternate paths to reflect the
organization’s “nice-to-have” list
➢ Building on the needs of both the end user and the organization
➢ A requirement of specific training for participants in negotiations
➢ Extracted key data elements of terms and conditions
➢ Provide information on the vendor, the negotiation, and the opportunity to all
relevant processes
➢ Providing a centralization of contracts through a global perspective to the
negotiations
After implementation of a winning Negotiations Planning Process, the end result of a
well executed plan becomes evident in that:
➢ The agreement reached represents the best available agreement for the
organization
➢ The agreement reached is a win-win situation for both parties
➢ Negotiators have specific information on all important criteria, not just price
➢ Opportunities for vendor consolidation are evaluated and followed where
appropriate
➢ Agreement types are those that best represent the needs of the organization,
whether enterprise, site specific, end user, etc
➢ The organization has explicit permission in the written agreement to use the
asset in the way that is required
➢ Dispute resolution is clearly covered in the written contract
Acquisition
143
GOAL 4: DEVELOP A PROCESS FOR DEFINING TERMS AND CONDITIONS
By definition, Terms and Conditions are legally binding clauses within a contract.
Standard terms and conditions are those clauses which an organization construes as
necessary, and in their perspective, should be included in every contract. It is the
primary objective of the negotiator to ensure that the finalized Terms and Conditions
agreed upon are conducive to the organization’s needs and that they instill purpose such
as:
➢ Standardization of organizational contracts
➢ A complete understanding of contractual clauses
➢ Reducing interpretation time
➢ Increasing business value
➢ To best mitigate organizational risk
➢ To define audit and verification rights
➢ To provide for contingency planning
Clearly, the list shown above is but a brief sampling of Terms and Condition factors.
They do though represent the positive organizational gain in the sense that when
specific guidelines (T’s & C’s) are established, there remains little room for guessing.
Further positive attributes of well defined Terms and Conditions would include:
➢ Ease of documentation management
➢ Organizational needs are recognized and addressed
➢ Organizational needs are better understood through a specified planning
process
➢ Mutually beneficial agreements are planned and executed
➢ Strengthening vendor relationships
➢ Streamlining the vendor management process
➢ Defining what is necessary to be in compliance
BP2
144
➢ The promoting of risk sharing between multiple organizational entities
GOAL 5: DEVELOP A REDEPLOYMENT PROCESS
In today’s ever-changing world of new technology, there are still times when the most
cost-efficient segment of Asset Management is to redeploy assets where applicable.
Savings to the organization are multi-faceted, and seen in such ways that redeployment:
➢ Minimizes unnecessary purchases
➢ Minimizes hoarding
➢ Optimizes re-use of leased equipment, especially those without early-return
options or punitive early-return expenses
➢ Reduces over purchasing of software licenses
➢ Reflects a cost-benefit analysis of the added usage and reduced capital expense
against operational and shipping costs
➢ lessens data security risks
➢ Flows as a component of the IMAC processes
➢ Keeps warehoused assets (temperature), repaired, reconfigured and cleaned
prior to deployment
➢ Helps to more accurately maintain software counts
➢ Retains only legally-moved software licenses
When redeployment is utilized, benefits are spread far throughout the organization and
well defined in that:
➢ Effective use of a centralized process is facilitated, potentially across department
/ division lines, depending on the organization’s culture
➢ Financial implications such as chargeback encourage reuse whenever possible
➢ Existing standards are supported
➢ End users are more apt to be previously trained on redeployed assets, and very
satisfied to receive requested assets in an expedient manner
Acquisition
145
➢ Budget managers receive a benefit for giving up unused assets and benefit (or
receive no negative reinforcement) from a reduced per-unit cost for redeployed
assets
➢ The security of organizational data already installed on redeployed assets is
maintained
➢ Reports on capitalized assets, and assets with property tax implications are
provided to finance for further calculative deduction
➢ Redeployment of assets is accurately and easily tracked
INTRODUCTION TO PROCUREMENT
The Procurement process within an IT Asset Management program functions to support
all purchases relating to IT including services, supplies, equipment, maintenance, anything
that has to be purchased. Procurement is a key factor within the IT Asset Management
program in that purchasing the correct items and services in a timely manner will
reduce chaos within the organization. Procurement must also take in to account the
business needs of the organization at all times throughout the purchasing cycle. Over
the years, procurement has been looked at as a fancy name for purchasing, in reality
procurement includes much more than purchasing. Procurement must evaluate the
actual business needs verses the perceived business needs before a purchase is
approved. Procurement must look not only at the best price, but also the best value for
the organization, which many times is not the best price. Procurement must evaluate
the return of investment, the compatibility of the item within the current environment,
vendor evaluations, and balance all this information with delivery times, cost, and
additional services.
DEFINITION OF PROCUREMENT
A procurement process is a method used that results in the best value in terms of
function and total cost of ownership. Procurement includes the act of purchasing and
understanding the business needs of the organization.
BP2
146
PURPOSE OF PROCUREMENT
The procurement process provides high-quality products and services at the best value
while meeting the requirements of stated time frames, while accomplishing business
objectives. Procurement is the initial stage for lifecycle management.
VALUES SEEN IN THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS INCLUDE:
➢ Receiving the best value for the organization through product evaluations and
supplier source analysis
➢ Centralized, controlled purchasing for the organization
➢ Risk mitigation on strategic business information and future plans
➢ Quality control of equipment and services entering in to the environment
➢ Economy of scale to leverage volume purchases
CONTRACTUAL OPPORTUNITIES
Asset management has benefited from the attention of the contracts and legal
departments historically due to the large dollar figure generally associated with
acquisitions. Now, the purchase of IT equipment has become more of a commodity
purchase and as such, software purchases now require special attention. This section
focuses on common strategies used when contracting for hardware and the associated
service.
VOLUME PURCHASE AGREEMENTS
One strategy that has been very successful for hardware purchases is to negotiate a
volume purchase agreement. With this type of agreement, the organization commits to
a level of purchasing for a given time period. With that expectation set, a deal can be
consummated where even the initial asset purchased receives the volume discount.
This type of deal requires excellent record keeping by both parties. The tendency is to
allow the vendor to supply the records only, which can lead to a contention at the end
of the time period when a “true up” is required. In this type of agreement, it is 
Acquisition
147
recommended that the Asset Manager either maintain separate records or to enact a
process to verify the vendor’s feed as it is received. A road block to these types of
agreements has been the lack of a global system within the organization. For instance, it
is not unusual to find several separate ERP’s (Enterprise Resource System) or financial
systems, within a multi-national company. The IT asset management processes and
systems can serve as the bridge to create a global view between disperate systems and
vendors.
The benefits of the volume purchase agreement are clearly financial along with the side
benefits of easing the application of standards and of streamlining the process of
acquisition. However, the financial advantage can be lost if the ongoing purchases are
not directed to that vendor. There are two reasons that this happens, the first is a lack
of communication regarding the existence of the volume purchase agreement.
Certainly, implementing asset management practices are the answer to this problem.
Second, there can be dissatisfaction with either the assets themselves or the services of
the vendor that drive frustrated managers to pursue other vendors. Without adequate
internal feedback, the Asset Manager can be caught by surprise and see projected
savings disappear. As a recommended practice, the Asset Manager should forge lines of
communication with the Help Desk and budget managers so that issues are identified
early. Large organizations should consider a more formal feedback program to make
sure that all opinions are heard, whether or not a volume purchase agreement is in
place.
A notable disadvantage to this type of agreement can be living with the consequences of
such a long commitment, since changes in plans and technology may make the volume
difficult to attain the maximum level. Also, the agreement may lock the organization
into a set price that does not reflect changes in the market prices. The Asset Manager
should suggest that the agreement includes language to cover these issues in a way that
still represents a good deal for all parties.
MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS
Maintenance contracts are frequently negotiated at the same time as the contract for
the asset itself and often renewed over the length of the lifecycle of those assets. These
contracts are a prime source for savings through careful review. For instance, consider
the warranty period on the equipment. Does the maintenance period begin while the 
BP2
148
warranty is still in effect? Is that appropriate, or unnecessary? When will the bulk of
the equipment actually be installed in the organization? Will maintenance be in effect
before a significant percentage of the equipment has been received or installed?
Checking the IT plan for the refresh schedule before completing the negotiations is an
ideal source for this information for desktops and laptops. The start date of the
maintenance needs to be part of the negotiations as the vendor often implies the start
date of the maintenance with either the date of the signature, or the date that the first
piece of equipment is delivered.
The internal make up of the organization may dictate whether signing a maintenance
agreement makes sense in any instance. If the Help Desk routinely provides front line
support to hardware users for rapid response, the use of internal capabilities should be
taken into account before signing a maintenance agreement.
Another aspect of maintenance contracts to be reviewed is the renewal process.
➢ Does the contract automatically renew if notification is not received
➢ To whom must that notification be sent
➢ What is the time frame for that notification
When contracts have an automatic renewal, a system that notifies the Asset Manager
prior to the renewal date is a valuable component to a renewal analysis program.
A renewal analysis program is a cost savings action that evaluates the current
maintenance contracts and determines whether or not the expense of the maintenance
is a good investment. When starting this process, it is not unusual to find maintenance
contracts on equipment that is no longer in service. Until asset management practices
are in place, it can simply be too difficult a process to find this information.
Once the first step of comparing the maintenance contract to equipment that is actually
in service is complete, the Asset Manager next analyzes the service records on the
equipment to determine the extent of the service used. This information is used to
calculate whether the correct level of service has been purchased, or whether it would
be cost effective to drop back to a less-expensive model and pay a little more for each
instance because the volume is lower than expected. An evaluation of the response
time required and the risk to the organization of raising the response time requirement
is also facilitated by review of the service records. The Asset Manager may not be able 
Acquisition
149
to judge risk from these records and should discuss proposed response time changes
with the involved managers.
When a determination is reached, the Asset Manager must set up a notification so that
the required change is communicated to the provider prior to contract renewal. Since
most contract renewals specify the required time frame for notification, it is important
that the renewal analysis be conducted at least 30-60 days prior to the notification
deadline, which is typically 60-90 days prior to the contract renewal date.
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS
Many of the analysis activities for determining the level and value of a maintenance
agreement are also conducted during the execution of a Service Level Agreement (SLA).
An evaluation of existing service records for the equipment being considered for an SLA
should be conducted to determine the base line service today, and the satisfaction level
with the response time to date. These types of agreements have a wide usage with
outsourced services, as well as internal uses.
Service Level agreements are often put into place by astute IT managers to both clarify
and quantify the services delivered by IT to their end customers, and to the internal
management team. The “black box” view of IT can be a real problem at budget time,
especially in this current economy. Proactive IT managers are tying different levels of
service to the budget levels, and negotiating agreements with the managers as you
would with an outside service. Also, internal SLAs are a meaningful step to take before
negotiating an outsourcing agreement. This is an excellent method for detailing the
specific services and the response time required for each type of hardware and
software. Asset Managers should work with the IT managers to perform the analysis so
that asset management practices can benefit from the new insight into the needs of the
organization, and from the additional data available on the assets.
Service Level Agreements are an ideal addition to those organizations using chargeback
for IT functions. Chargeback is a common accounting strategy, but many have felt that
chargeback tools have been lacking essential data to build a full picture of the actual
usage of the tools and services. With the analysis required for an SLA, the first step
towards building a more complete view has been taken. The next step is to keep
collecting the service level data points and to include them in the database for 
BP2
150
chargeback. There are numerous tools that will help accomplish this task, although
completely automating this process is probably a rare and costly exercise.
OUTSOURCING AGREEMENTS
When an outsourcing agreement for the service and support of the desktop
environment and network is being negotiated, the Asset Manager needs to make sure
that the asset inventory is accurate. The use of discovery tools are instrumental in
gathering this information, although Asset Managers should be aware that there are
assets that are not always involved in any one particular run of the discovery tool
(traveling laptops, for instance) and that the actual inventory should be in a master
document or database that is verified against repeated discovery runs. If transfer of the
assets is part of the negotiations, information on any asset tags and serial numbers
should also be added to the prepared lists. Not all assets may be handled the same way
in the outsourcing agreement, so identification to the specific serial number may be
necessary.
When discussing an outsourcing agreement, consider the equipment that the
outsourcer will be using, as it is unlikely that the corporate standards for hardware or
software will be considered.
As mentioned previously, the analysis for an internal Service Level Agreement can
greatly add to the understanding of the environment and what exactly should be built
into the outsourcing agreement. Outsourcing agreements that fail are often lacking
details so that expectations for service are not worked out and dissatisfaction is the end
result of the agreement. Since most outsourcing agreements are for a specific period of
time, the outsourcer would prefer that the agreement be renewed and a good
reference be gained. Avoiding misunderstanding from the beginning can be gained
through adding details to the scope of services that are based on a firm understanding of
the corporate needs.
LEASING
Leasing is an alternative to purchasing equipment and sometimes involves two separate
contracts, one with the leasing company and a second with a financing company. The
leasing company may provide both parts of the service, or may bring in a second 
Acquisition
151
company as part of their standard offering. Leasing agreements provide a structure for
leasing that may cover a period of months, with equipment arriving throughout that
leasing period as needed. Tracking these batches of assets to the serial number, with
location and termination date during their period of use is a challenging activity that
drives the Asset Management Processes in those organizations that have chosen to lease
some or all of their equipment. Best practice requires the batches of assets be tied to
the contractual documents that apply to them, either through a contractual number
cross reference, or being physically filed with the agreement.
The leasing model can include many types of equipment, with desktop and laptop
computing being frequent candidates for leasing. Leasing is a strategic decision that
executive management may choose in order to:
➢ Gain additional flexibility to handle unpredictable growth
➢ Allow rapid technical refresh
➢ Reduce capital expense
➢ Avoid disposal and recycling issues
The flexibility gained through leasing is beneficial to organizations expecting rapid
changes in business needs, such as those arising during mergers, acquisitions,
divestitures, software upgrades or architecture upgrades. Organizations may choose a
lease to avoid being tied to a particular level or type of equipment beyond the lease
period. Organizations negotiate early termination or the ability to add to the lease to
handle business changes that impact the volume of assets required.
The financial advantage of reducing capital outlay can be the sole reason that some
organizations lease. In a traditional or operating lease, the leased assets remain the
property of the leasing company, which also can be beneficial to the organization’s
financial standing. Organizations may choose to lease because of a mismatch on the
length of time the equipment is needed and the normal period of time that purchased
equipment is depreciated. An additional financial benefit is that the organization gains
access to the equipment needed without a significant up front cost. Smaller, monthly
payments that can be predicted and thus budgeted are an incentive for leasing.
Organizations that lease have a tax benefit as well. Leasing changes the tax position to
an overhead expense that can be deducted from the organization’s income.
BP2
152
Making the decision on whether to lease or not, definitely involves many internal
technical and financial criteria. Industry trends also greatly impact the use of this option,
such as the rapid increase in capabilities of PCs coincident with the growing demands for
computing power by software packages.
The contractual elements for lease agreements have a great deal of variability driven by
the requirements of the leasing organization and the leasing company’s preferred
manner of doing business. For instance, an organization may negotiate a lease rate
factor which is a term applied to the equation that determines the monthly price for the
assets and that is dependent upon the volume of assets leased. As more assets are
leased, the monthly price drops. As this example illustrates, leasing agreements have
significant financial issues that must be negotiated in addition to the logistical aspects to
manage the asset movement. The table below lists some of the financial and logistical
topics that are included within leasing negotiations, and subsequently in the legal
document.

➢ What is the official start date for
the equipment, when it is

Lifecycle ➢ What is the warranty period on
this asset?
➢ Who will be performing

➢ Are modifications to the asset
permissible?
➢ What is the procedure for lost

➢ If the asset is not in use, can it
be subleased or returned?
Termination ➢ What are the acceptable
conditions for the asset when it
is to be returned?
➢ Does the asset being returned
have to be of like type, or be the
actual serial numbered asset that
was leased?
➢ Is keeping the asset an option?
➢ What are the notification
requirements for renewal or 
Acquisition
155
termination?
➢ What security measures can be
used to prevent exposure of
corporate data?
The logistical aspects of leasing can be a powerful motivator for developing Asset
Management programs. For those expanding their asset management programs to
include leasing, the Asset management must insure that the current processes and
systems handle the informational needs for successful leasing or adapt the processes.
Familiarity with the specific terms and conditions that apply to the assets during their
use and termination are critical factors in obtaining the highest financial benefit from a
leasing program. For instance, the warranty and maintenance terms may dictate
alternative processes and could limit the organization’s choices at the end of the lease,
even if a sound financial base exists for purchasing at the end of the lease.
The lease programs that have failed to perform as desired in an organization often did
not adequately prepare an infrastructure. It was not uncommon for leased assets to be
disposed of without anyone being aware that they were leased assets until it was too
late. The organization had to pay the buy-out amount for an asset that was already
gone. Lease programs without adequate infrastructure may be paying monthly fees for
an asset no longer in use! It is recommended that the Asset Manager participate in the
negotiations for the lease contract and take responsibility before the contract is
executed for identifying the changes that need to occur in process.
The complexity of large scale leasing also can lead to a high rate of invoicing errors. An
IAITAM member has reported finding $10,000 of errors quarterly in the leasing invoices
for the desktop environment of a large organization. Since leases are long term
agreements, it is important to watch for the return of these errors in case the leasing
company’s correction was not applied properly to the entire payment stream.
It is important to note that there are many types of lease agreements, separated into
categories based on the ownership of the leased equipment. The most common lease is
the Traditional or Operating lease where the leasing company owns the equipment.
This type of lease was used as the basis for the financial criteria listed above. 
BP2
156
Advantages from risk reduction for disposal issues only occur if the leasing company is
the owner of the equipment and thus responsible for the correct disposal of the asset.
According to the Electronic Leasing Association in their online leasing guide
http://www.leaseassistant.org), the second most common type is a Finance Lease. This
type of lease allows the lessee to claim ownership for both the tax benefit and the
expected residual high value of the equipment. Typically, the lessee purchases the
equipment for a prearranged fee at the end of the lease, but different lessors have
introduced options here as well. For the Finance Lease and the other types of leases
that are negotiated, each will need to address the same questions as above, but will have
different choices and answers.
ANALYSING NEW PRICING STRUCTURES
Vendors often try new pricing models, or develop new ways of selling or allocating their
products or services to the organization. It is common for these new schemes to be
widely advertised and discussed in the trade media. As a professional in Asset
Management, it is important to evaluate the nature of the pricing model and determine
the impact to your organization. For instance, a set of vendors are currently advocating
a method called utility computing, grid computing or on-demand computing depending
on the source. With this model, the contract locks in on today’s prices, but allows the
organization to only pay for what they need, allowing for growth and fluctuations. As
with any new pricing scheme, analysis is required to confirm whether this approach is a
viable alternative for the organization. Below are some questions that should be asked
in addition to the financial number crunching of the analysis:
➢ How does this pricing model fit our environment? (In the example of on
demand, the question could be: Are there regular upswings in the need for
computing power and/or storage that are temporary)
➢ Are there other changes in lifecycle processes that should be considered for
savings without switching to this pricing strategy? (In the example, the question
could be: Can the lifecycle process be tightened in any way to allow purchase of
computing power and storage closer to the actual need that would obviate the
benefit of the new approach)
Acquisition
157
➢ Are there environment restrictions imposed by the implementation of this
pricing scheme? What is the cost of upgrading the obsolete equipment
➢ Does this pricing scheme increase the risks associated with dependence on a
particular vendor? How difficult would it be to move to another vendor or
another pricing strategy
➢ Who owns the hardware and the associated assets (such as software)
➢ What is the impact on other contractual terms and condition for those
associated assets
➢ What is the data that will be used to calculate usage and how will it be provided
to the organization
➢ What systems are needed to collect and maintain this data
➢ How difficult will it be to eventually switch vendors
➢ Does this pricing scheme restrict the ability to purchase or lease from a more
traditional price scheme
➢ What secondary impacts occur because of this new strategy? (Software license
issues, network issues, etc.)
➢ Will the added equipment meet corporate standards?
➢ Does this pricing scheme transfer risk to the vendor? What is the value of that
reduction in risk
➢ What is the impact on other asset management practices and the cost of
adapting the processes
➢ How will the program be evaluated for success over time
New pricing schemes should be analyzed carefully, even if the “new” approach is actually
an adoption of a pricing scheme from another platform. For example, several of the
pricing methodologies from the mainframe world are now being applied to other
computing environments.
In summary, the application of a new pricing scheme may have far reaching impact into
the way asset management practices are performed and also how IT services in general 
BP2
158
are conducted. The Asset Manager must insure that the change is evaluated from more
perspectives than just a financial one. From the financial perspective, the questions
should always include a question regarding the maximum potential charge and the
possibilities for a cap. An analysis of impact should always be performed, even in the
circumstance where there appears to be no choice but to go to the new scheme, so
that proactive preparation can occur. 
Asset Identification Process
159
INTRODUCTION TO ASSET IDENTIFICATION
The Asset Identification Management Process Area encompasses the activities that
uniquely identify and validate the physical presence of IT assets. Asset Identification is a
key enabler of many related activities in the Software Life-cycle, Hardware Life-cycle and
IT Acquisition and Documentation Management Process Areas. The label that was
generated and affixed during the receiving process is a unique physical identification tag,
normally placed on the outside of the IT asset. It is an identifier and represents specific
information pertaining to that piece of equipment. Generally, labels that are used for
asset identification will have no meaning outside of the organization.
DEFINING ASSET IDENTIFICATION
The action or process of identifying assets. Identification can be accomplished in forms
such as bar coding, or RFID, which is useful for inventory, location and security
purposes. Control over assets and associated risks can’t be obtained until you know
what you possess.
PURPOSE OF THE ASSET IDENTIFICATION PROCESS AREA
Asset Identification is the process by which an asset can be uniquely identified along with
the attributes that define that asset. The IT Asset Management team generates the
unique identifier for each asset. The tag can be a series of numbers and letters, bar code
or RFID, and can contain encoding. For example, a printer could have the identifier
PP2006070128. Here, PP denotes a printer, 2006 and 07 represent the year and month
the printer was placed into service and 0128 is just a sequential number guaranteeing
uniqueness. This unique identifier is maintained in a database and is linked to the
attributes of the asset. For example, the attributes of a PC could include the operating

system version, hard disk size, etc. Asset identification enables an organization to look
inside its IT asset inventory with general ease.
HOW ASSET IDENTIFICATION RELATES TO IT ASSET
MANAGEMENT
IT assets are a part of an organization’s intellectual property and therefore part of the
organization’s overall value. IT assets are no different then any other asset that an
organization depends on for its operations. Whether it’s a stamping machine in a
manufacturing company, a truck in a transportation company, an IV pump in a hospital,
or a printer in a publishing company, all of these assets have become a vital part of their
perspective organization’s operations. The same holds true for IT assets. In addition to
the market value of an IT asset, there is value in the information stored on that
particular asset. Knowing where the asset is physically located accomplishes several
objectives including security, maintenance and inventory control.
IMPLEMENTATION GOALS FOR ASSET IDENTIFICATION
There are four (4) core goals for the best practices of Asset Identification. These
include:
➢ Defining the Physical Asset Identification Strategy
➢ Developing and implementing a common procedure for receiving, accepting and
notification process for all IT assets
➢ Notifying security when a new IT asset enters the IT environment
➢ Conducting a physical audit to discover all IT assets
Asset Identification is a dynamic ongoing process. It is impacted by the Disposal
Management policy and is implemented whenever an IT asset is introduced into the
environment, created or destroyed. If the identifier is encoded, then a new asset type
will affect the encoding algorithm causing a tradeoff between encoded and non-encoded
identifiers. All involved personnel within an organization must be educated on the policy
to ensure all IT assets are tagged and tracked. Careful consideration should be given to
the type of attributes associated with the identifier as well as integration with any 
Asset Identification Process
161
existing systems within the organization. Workflow must be considered when defining
the process.
GOAL 1: PHYSICAL ASSET IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY MUST BE DEFINED
Before the identification process can begin, an identification strategy must be defined
and established. An effective process should include:
➢ Specifying all asset types within the scope of the ITAM Program
➢ Identifying assets based upon business strategy
➢ Providing cross identification of the physical assets to the data collected with
automated discovery tools
This will enable provisions that:
➢ Will provide for asset categories to be defined for use in asset tracking systems
➢ Allow Information to be integrated and shared between multiple systems
➢ The burden of maintaining the physical inventory on a daily basis is absorbed by
the use of discovery tools
GOAL 2: ESTABLISH A COMMON PROCEDURE FOR RECEIVING, ACCEPTING, AND
NOTIFICATION OF HOW ALL IT ASSETS ARE MANAGED
Repetition provides for commonality. Establish a set of procedures covering asset
receiving, acceptance and department notification that:
➢ Centralizes all asset information through a set of common processes and
systems
By establishing a commonly understood set of procedures, the process can be easily
replicated with accuracy, time and time again. Accuracy is very important during this
process because of all the collateral asset information that is involved. The information
will be used to cause:
➢ A Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) process to be established
➢ A trigger to generate payment to the vendor
BP2
162
➢ The process of physical identification tags or devices to be affixed
➢ IT Asset Repository records to be updated
➢ Notification to be sent to a fixed-asset system
➢ Contingency plans to be updated
➢ Service desk and help desk requests for deployment to be facilitated
GOAL 3: SECURITY IS NOTIFIED WHEN A NEW IT ASSET ENTERS THE ENVIRONMENT
Establish an automated system that notifies security whenever an asset is accepted in to
the organization using accepted receiving procedures. This will provide for:
➢ An immediate record of asset receipt
Automated notification of new asset receipt will ensure that:
➢ Ongoing security is enabled immediately
➢ Loss, theft detection and resolution is enabled
GOAL 4: ALL IT ASSETS ARE DISCOVERED THROUGH PHYSICAL AUDIT
There must be a physical count at the beginning of every Asset Identification Program.
Accuracy is paramount in that a proper management program is only as effective as the
initial input. You can’t manage assets that you don’t know exist. Conduct the physical
audit in a way that:
➢ All assets are systematically located as to their physical presence
➢ Includes any non-reportable assets such as those in storage, monitors, devices
located in classified areas, non-networked devices, etc
After the physical audit, data is entered in to an automated system that will form an
updated asset database. The newly stored information will help to ensure that:
➢ Inventory accuracy of the IT asset repository is periodically updated
➢ Discrepancies in the IT asset repository information are resolved and corrected
Asset Identification Process
163
➢ Process improvements are made as a result of correcting root causes of IT asset
repository discrepancies
➢ Theft/Loss detection and prevention is enabled
➢ Asset status regarding any damage and potential impact on continued usability is
reported and recorded
➢ Unused assets are deployed or disposed of proactively
Commitments
The organization has committed to a physical audit strategy that is appropriate for the
size of company, the geographic issues and the critical nature of the asset type.
Acknowledging that physical inventory is accurate for only a brief period of time, the
organization commits to adopting a process of frequent automated discovery and
scheduled physical audits of those discovered assets in conjunction with other nonreportable assets documented in the asset repository. Resources and associated costs
have been identified and budgeted.
Capabilities
➢ The physical audit process is defined and will be executed

ASSET IDENTIFICATION STANDARDS EXAMPLE
(In this example <<Organization>> represents Hypothetical Industries, Inc. our
organization for purposes of example)
Scope
<< Organization >> requires Vendors to follow << Organization >> requirements for
asset tags and box labeling when shipping computer hardware to
<< Organization >>.
The Vendor must apply a << Organization >> bar-coded asset tag to each unit, prepare
an electronic Vendor Asset Tag Report, apply a standard box label (“Vendor
Information Tag” or VIT) to each computer hardware box, and attach a packing slip to
every shipment.
1.1 Equipment Requiring Asset Tags
A << Organization >> bar coded asset tag must be placed on all computer hardware,
including:
➢ Desktop and laptop computers
➢ Tablet PCs
➢ CRT and LCD monitors
➢ Network printers
Asset tags are not required for personal, non-networked printers.
1.2 Purpose of this Document
This document provides asset tag and box labeling standards for
<< Organization >> vendors who supply desktop computers, laptops, tablet PCs, CRT
& LCD monitors, and network printers.
To ensure proper tracking of computer hardware shipped to << Organization >>,
Vendors must follow all the guidelines and meet all the requirements described in this
document.
BP2
168
General Procedures
The computer hardware Vendor must follow these guidelines when preparing computer
hardware for shipment to <<< Organization >>>.
2.1 Asset Tags
Apply << Organization >> bar coded asset tags to all new computer hardware prior to
shipment.
2.2 Asset Tag Report
Prepare an electronic Vendor Asset Tag Report, which includes detailed information for
each unit in the shipment. For data accuracy, a bar-code reader must be used to collect
data from the computer hardware. The report must be emailed to << Organization >>
before the shipment arrives at the
<< Organization >> Central Warehouse.
2.3 Vendor Information Tag (VIT)
Apply a standard box label (known as the “Vendor Information Tag” or VIT) to all
computer hardware boxes shipped to << Organization >>. Because
<< Organization >> will scan all boxes when they are received, the box labels must
conform to << Organization >> requirements so that the scanning device can read the
label.
2.4 Packing Slips
Attach a packing slip to every shipment. Packing slips must include a Vendor Asset Tag
Report showing the << Organization >> PO number with a list of the asset tag numbers
and serial numbers for every unit included in the shipment.
3.1 Asset Tag Procedures
The Vendor must apply << Organization >> bar-coded asset tags to all new computer
hardware prior to shipment. This section explains the << Organization >> asset tag
requirements and illustrates the correct placement of the asset tag for different types of
assets.
3.2 Asset Tag Requirements
Asset Identification Process
169
The computer hardware Vendor must use the following procedures when placing
<<organization >> bar-coded asset tags on computer hardware.
3.3 Tag application preparation and placement
(A) Use isopropyl alcohol to clean the area where the asset tag is to be placed on the
hardware.
(B) Limit finger contact with the adhesive on the back of the tag
(C) Place the asset tag straight on the hardware. The location depends on the type of
hardware, as follows:
a) For desktop computers, monitors and network printers, place the asset tag so
that it is readily visible from the front.
b) For laptops and tablet PCs, place the asset tag on the cover on the top right
back corner.
c) For flat panel monitors, place the asset tag on the frame.
(D) Do not place the asset tag on removable parts of any asset hardware
The foregoing example is a brief prelude to the specific Asset ID tagging procedures in
use throughout the industry. The idea conveyed is that regardless of the specific
procedures used in your organization, or who it is that actually tags the assets, the fact
remains that a well documented procedure showing every detail must be in place to
achieve accuracy and efficiency.
Asset Identification and tracking is so very important to the entire organization.
Necessary for financial, security, replacement or refresh, disposal, audit, compliance, and
the list goes on. It is absolutely critical that policy and procedures are in place, updated
as necessary and adhered to by all persons involved, to maintain an accurate inventory. 

Disposal Management
171
INTRODUCTION TO DISPOSAL MANAGEMENT
The Disposal Process Area defines process and procedures for properly removing
assets from your environment. A mature disposal process will allow your enterprise to
avoid costly storage of unused assets, mitigate risk associated with disposal, reallocation
of software, security of information maintained before the disposal process, while
increasing return on investment.
DEFINING DISPOSAL MANAGEMENT
The action or process of throwing away, or getting rid of something.
PURPOSE OF DISPOSAL MANAGEMENT
Disposal is the means in which an asset is properly destroyed. Destroying an asset is
much more than just throwing it away in the trash. Destroying an asset impacts several
groups within the organization including but not limited to IT, finance, human resources,
procurement and legal. The method used to destroy the asset may be constrained by
government regulations, vendor licensing agreements and the organization’s policies.
WHY DISPOSAL MANAGEMENTR TO IT ASSET MANAGEMENT
IT assets are considered part of the organization’s intellectual property and need to be
discarded in accordance with the organization’s policies, the vendor’s policies and the
local, state and federal government’s regulations. Any part of the asset that can be
reused must be recovered during the disposal process and all information relative to the
organization removed from the asset in such a manner as to guarantee the information
cannot be discovered.
Chapter 12
DISPOSAL MANAGEMENT 
BP2
172
IMPLEMENTATION GOALS FOR DISPOSAL MANAGEMENT
IAITAM has defined six core goals as part of the best practice for Disposal Management:
➢ To Dispose of Assets Legally and Securely
➢ Asset Disposal Requirements are Identified and Understood
➢ Disposed Assets are Accurately Tracked
➢ The End of Life Process is Defined and The Disposal Procedures are
Implemented
➢ Software is Harvested and Reallocated During the Disposal Cycle
➢ Information Security for Disposed Assets is Ensured
Disposal Management is a continuous process within the organization. The purpose of
having an IT asset disposal policy is to:
➢ Maintain compliance with local, state and federal government regulations and in
line with the policies of the organization
➢ Maintain compliance with the policies of the asset’s vendor, manufacturer or
distributor
Proper disposal of IT assets requires the cooperation of everyone in the organization.
Each functional group within the organization must be made aware of the disposal policy
including the purpose, the benefits and risks and how it directly affects their functional
area. For example, the finance group needs to know when an asset is disposed of for
the purpose of accurately reflecting the organization’s asset sheet and for tax reporting
purposes. The IT Asset Management team should make no assumptions of how the
disposal of an asset impacts another group within the organization, only that it does
affect other business groups.
GOAL 1: THE ORGANIZATION DISPOSES OF ASSETS LEGALLY AND SECURELY
In accordance with government regulations, directives and policies, All assets must be
disposed in a way that:
➢ Addresses all federal, state and local laws, as well as organizational policy
Disposal Management
173
A proper disposal plan will effectively ensure that:
➢ Fines from environmental regulatory agencies are mitigated
➢ Environmental safety is addressed
➢ Privacy and information security is guaranteed
➢ Risks for negative media and public exposure are mitigated
GOAL 2: ASSET DISPOSAL REQUIREMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED AND UNDERSTOOD
The IT Asset Manager must understand all aspects of the asset disposal process. It is
that person’s responsibility to:
➢ Explore all disposal options
➢ Support the disposal process in accordance with the organizational policy
➢ Identify specific contractual language to support organization’s goals
➢ Reflect the needs of all departments including those needs particular to fixed
assets
By following all prescribed policies, the IT Asset Manager ensures that:
➢ Disposal costs are minimized
➢ Compliance regulations are followed
➢ Selection of disposal methodologies is part of the portfolio management of
assets
➢ All legal requirements are met
GOAL 3: DISPOSED ASSETS ARE ACCURATELY TRACKED
An important part of the disposal process is verification of asset location and/or
disposition. Throughout the life of the asset, the IT Asset Manager must ensure that:
➢ Records reflect all retired assets
BP2
174
➢ Certificate of Disposition clearly documents the change of ownership
responsibility
➢ Inventory tracking process updates other related systems
➢ Any significant financial consequences are reported promptly
In addition to the legalities involved in asset disposal, other benefits are derived that
include:
➢ Asset maintenance and support are not being paid for retired or stored
software
➢ Transfer of asset ownership includes legal responsibility for the asset
➢ Unused software licenses are recovered and pooled or re-assigned
➢ Disaster Recovery plans are updated
➢ Executive management responsible for public reporting has confidence in the
accuracy of inventories as reported
➢ Transparency of financial reporting is maintained
GOAL 4: THE END OF LIFE PROCESS IS DEFINED AND THE DISPOSAL PROCEDURES ARE
IMPLEMENTED
When redeployment is not an option, proper end of life disposal procedures must be
used. When utilizing these procedures, the IT Asset Manager will be able to:
➢ Dispose of assets in a timely manner
➢ Ensure that the program is equipped to handle both the normal end of the
lifecycle flow as well as unexpected high-volume disposal events
➢ Confirm that ownership information is removed from the assets
➢ Accurately manage a mixed environment of leased and owned equipment
When redeployment is not an option, benefits can still be derived even when the asset
is marked for end of life destruction. Some of these benefits are that:
➢ Storage costs are minimized
Disposal Management
175
➢ Maintenance and support are not paid for retired or stored software
➢ Cost-effectiveness through disposal volumes can be realized
➢ Equipment ceases to be listed as assets to the organization
➢ Business events such as mergers and acquisitions do not introduce risk of
improper handling
➢ Assets are disposed in a manner appropriate to their ownership status
GOAL 5: SOFTWARE IS HARVESTED AND REALLOCATED DURING THE DISPOSAL CYCLE
There is no valid reason to purchase new software if there is software available from
assets marked for disposal. Whenever possible, the IT Asset Manager will benefit the
organization by:
➢ Recovering software for redeployment
➢ Reallocating software to replenish the software library
➢ Redeploying software only when permissible according to the license agreement
When software is harvested from assets marked for destruction, specific criteria must
be met, and will provide benefit in ways that:
➢ Software can be redistributed in a timely manner
➢ Additional unnecessary software purchases can be avoided
➢ Software not actually tied via the license to a particular hardware asset, can be
harvested and reallocated as necessary
GOAL 6: INFORMATION SECURITY FOR DISPOSED ASSETS IS ENSURED
What ever the method chosen by the organization, data removal tools must perform
the following functions:
➢ Extract all data from hardware prior to disposal
➢ Expunge all remaining information
Using the proper data removal tools will ensure that:
BP2
176
➢ Critical data is secured prior to disposal
➢ No information may be obtained from the asset after disposal
CORE PROCESSES FOR EFFECTIVE DISPOSAL MANAGEMENT
➢ The organization disposes of assets legally and securely
➢ Asset disposal requirements are identified and understood
➢ Disposed assets are accurately tracked
➢ The end of life process is defined and the disposal procedures are implemented
➢ Software is harvested and reallocated during the Disposal Cycle
➢ Information security for disposed assets is ensured
Commitments
➢ The organization is committed to disposal of assets in a timely, legal,
environmentally-safe and cost-effective manner
➢ Asset disposal receipts are retained permanently and managed as part of the
Documentation Management process area
➢ The organization acknowledges that managing the life-cycle of the asset to final
disposition of the asset is a significant component of the organization’s business
practices that comprise IT asset management, even if the organization perceives
no external controls that could influence disposal
Capabilities
➢ The disposal process is defined and includes a disposal schedule
➢ The organization understands the IT Asset Disposal Policy, procedures and
requirements. The organization is aware of the impacts and penalties that can
arise from improper disposal.
➢ Disposal requirements have been adequately defined and validated by the
organization
➢ Disposal procedures exist and are understood by all impacted personnel
Disposal Management

Introduction to Glossary of Terms
Our members have requested a usable glossary of terms and definitions to be shared
across the enterprise. Since many terms have dual, or even several definitions, the
following list of terms are made specifically for the ITAM professional to understand
ITAM terminology. This will allow IT Asset Management needs to be understood across
the organization. Additionally, though this information may not directly impact the day

License - Click Wrap /Through
License
This license schema, almost a direct result of
the internet, is usually present along with an
application you download off the web.
Before you can proceed with the download,
you must click a box indicating that you agree
with and will comply with the accompanying
license. The issue is that most people do not
read these agreements before clicking and do
not print a copy of the license when they do
read it.
Additional issues include the occasional
license that is simply unreadable or a license
so highly compressed that it can’t be read. In
another click style of license, the user
commits to the license agreement merely
through loading the software. This “could”
mean that the simple act of placing the CD in
the drive and initializing the configuration
menu also initiates a binding license. More
often, there is a license statement buried in a
series of configuration click through events.
Your technical personnel, used to rapidly
clicking through and accepting the defaults
while installing software, simply click right
past the new license without ever noticing.

License – Competitive upgrade This is another “click” style license where the
user commits to the license agreement
merely through loading the software. This
“could” mean that the simple act of placing
the CD in the drive and initiating the
configuration menu also initiates a binding
end user license agreement (EULA). More
often though, there will be a license
statement buried in a series of configuration
click-through events. This is advantages to
the licensor in that anyone installing the
program might have a tendency of rapidly
clicking through and accepting the defaults
and might inadvertently accept the license
terms and conditions without even being
aware of it.

processors within that device.
License - Public Domain Such a license is sometimes called a "publicdomain equivalent license," which is
somewhat of a misnomer. A more accurate
term is "permissive free software". Software
available in the public domain is technically
not licensed at all, they are not even
copyrighted. This means that you are free to
use what is available in the public domain as

Radio Frequency Tag (active) Active RFID tags are designed to constantly
transmit the contained information into the
surrounding area. This allows for any
personnel with an associated receiver to
move through the environment and gather
the information quite easily. The downside of
active RFID tags is that they are relatively
expensive to manufacture, and require a
dedicated and constant power source. The
power source can be a battery within the tag
or power from the asset that the tag is
affixed to. Active tags are more costly than
passive or semi-active tags and are normally
used for high-dollar or mission-critical assets.
Radio Frequency Tag (passive) Passive RFID tags rely entirely on the reader
as their power source. These tags can be
read up to about 20 feet away, are rather
cost effective to manufacture, and are made
to be disposable for use on less expensive
assets.
Radio Frequency Tag (semiactive)
Semi-active tags (sometimes referred to as
semi-passive) also rely on the reader to
supply its power for broadcasting. Because
these tags contain more hardware than
passive RFID tags, they are more expensive
to manufacture. Active and semi-active tags
are reserved for more costly items and
transmit at high frequencies that allow
readings over greater distances, sometimes as
much as 100 feet or more.
